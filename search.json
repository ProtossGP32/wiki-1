Some of the key modules of the Spring Framework include:\n\nSpring Core: The core module provides the fundamental functionality of the Spring Framework, including dependency injection, inversion of control, and support for aspect-oriented programming.\nSpring MVC: The MVC (Model-View-Controller) module provides a web-oriented framework for building web applications, and supports the development of web applications using a “front controller” pattern.\nSpring Data: The Data module provides tools and libraries for working with data sources and databases, and supports the development of data-oriented applications.\nSpring Security: The Security module provides tools and libraries for implementing authentication and authorization in applications, and supports the development of secure applications.\nSpring Boot: The Boot module provides a way to quickly and easily create stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. Spring Boot uses an “opinionated” approach to configuration, which means that it provides a set of default configurations that are designed to work well together, and allows developers to get started quickly without having to spend a lot of time configuring the application.\n\nOverall, the Spring Framework is a powerful and popular toolkit for building enterprise-level applications in Java, and provides a wide range of tools and libraries for supporting various aspects of application development. By using the Spring Framework, developers can take advantage of the framework’s modular design, and can choose the specific modules that are most relevant to their needs and goals."

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.\nCSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.\nAfter CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.\nreference: CSS: Cascading Style Sheets"

We’ll read the same data into R, do some grouping and summarization, then make it available to OJS using ojs_define:\n\n\n#| output: false\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nco2 = read_csv(\"co2_mm.csv\")  %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(max = max(average))\n\nojs_define(co2data = co2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb APIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb APIs You can use the d3.json() function to read JSON data from web services and data sources.

Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page’s appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).\n\n\n“Hypertext” refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.\nHTML uses “markup” to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special “elements” such as\n<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, \n<div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>,\n<embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>\nand many others.\nAn HTML element is set off from other text in a document by tags, which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.\nReference: HyperText Markup Language"

When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\nFor example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., this text is bold). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

    "text": "2 How Does it Work?\nDillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff happening behind the scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the process works in general.\nWhen you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready document?\nThe short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in web browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown processor\n\n\n\nMarkdown applications use something called a Markdown processor (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation of this process below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown app\n\n\n\nThe Markdown application and processor are two separate components. For the sake of brevity, I’ve combined them into one element (“Markdown app”) in the figure below. The Markdown Process\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\n\nTo summarize, this is a four-part process:\n\nCreate a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.\nOpen the Markdown file in a Markdown application.\nUse the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.\nView the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.\n\nFrom your perspective, the process will vary somewhat depending on the application you use. For example, Dillinger essentially combines steps 1-3 into a single, seamless interface — all you have to do is type in the left pane and the rendered output magically appears in the right pane. But if you use other tools, like a text editor with a static website generator, you’ll find that the process is much more visible."

These are written nearly identically to a series of vanilla markdown code snippets, except for their distinct lack of an additional line break separating each subsequent block:\njavascript I'm A tab\nconsole.log('Code Tab A');\n\njavascript I'm tab B\nconsole.log('Code Tab B');\nCustom CSS\n.markdown-body {\n  --md-code-background: #e3dcef;\n  --md-code-text: #4a2b7b;\n  --md-code-tabs: #c6b8dd;\n  --md-code-radius: 4px;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to import that feature Navigate by Tabs into Quarto?\n\n\n\nThis could work but it has been NOT tested:\n\nYou could convert Readme Markdown to Quarto Markdown, using a tool like Markdown Converter (https://markdown.pioul.fr/), which supports both flavors of Markdown.\nOr Markdowon Parser form Flexmark Java library\n\nIn any case, they are not Extensions within Quarto … so, for now, there is NOT an easy and direct solution to do this conversion.\n\n\n\n\n3.10 Approach #5: using Revealjs Quarto\nTabsets Revealjs Quarto\nCreate a tabset via a markdown div with the class name panel-tabset (e.g. ::: {.panel-tabset}).\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\nTab content for R language code and stuff\n\n## Python\n\nTab content for Python language code and stuff\n:::\nEach top-level heading within the div creates a new tab.

This is because burnout can develop gradually over time as a result of chronic stress.\n\nPeople may start to feel overwhelmed and exhausted, but they often attribute these feelings to other factors such as a demanding job or family responsibilities.\n\nFreudenberger also emphasizes the importance of** decision-making in stopping stress and preventing burnout. He notes that people who are at risk of burnout are often those who are highly driven, work-focused, and driven by their desire to achieve.\nHowever, they may also be prone to neglecting their own well-being and making decisions that increase their stress levels."

In this major new book its originator, Jeff Sutherland, explains precisely and step by step how it operates - and how it can be made to work for anyone, anywhere. Take the FBI attempt to digitize its records, for example. As with so many software projects the first attempt failed, having taken four years and cost over $400 million.Then the FBI turned to Scrum, and just over a year later unveiled a functioning system that cost less than a tenth of the first project and employed a tenth of the staff. And it’s not just grand projects that Scrum can help with.\nEvery organisation, whatever its size, constantly has to come to grips with delivering a product or service on time and on budget. Scrum shows you how. It explains how to define precisely what it is that you are seeking to achieve, how to set up the team to achieve it, and how to monitor progress until the project is successfully completed. Filled with practical examples drawn from all types and organisation it will make you rethink the fundamentals of successful management - and show you how to get things done however everyday or ambitious, however small or large your organisation."

In The Status Game, bestselling author Will Storr radically turns this thinking on its head by arguing that it is our irrepressible craving for status that ultimately defines who we are.\nFrom the era of the hunter-gatherer to today, when we exist as workers in the globalised economy and citizens of online worlds, the need for status has always been wired into us. A wealth of research shows that how much of it we possess dramatically affects not only our happiness and wellbeing but also our physical health – and without sufficient status, we become more ill, and live shorter lives. It’s an unconscious obsession that drives the best and worst of us: our innovation, arts and civilisation as well as our murders, wars and genocides. But why is status such an all-consuming prize? What happens if it’s taken away from us? And how can our unquenchable thirst for it explain cults, moral panics, conspiracy theories, the rise of social media and the ‘culture wars’ of today?\nOn a breathtaking journey through time and culture, The Status Game offers a sweeping rethink of human psychology that will change how you see others – and how you see yourself"

No matter your station, you possess incredible unique powers. It’s a modern myth that hard work and hustle are the paths to success. Inside you is a soul. And once you unleash it fully into the domain of work, magic happens. Awakening the Buddha and the Badass inside you is a process that will disrupt the way you work altogether. You’ll gain access to tools that bend the very rules of reality.\n\nThe Buddha is the archetype of the spiritual master. The person who can live in this world but also move with an ease, grace, and flow that comes from inner awareness and alignment.\nThe Badass is the archetype of the changemaker. This is the person who is out there creating change, building, coding, writing, inventing, leading. The badass represents the benevolent disruptor—the person challenging the norms so we can be better as a species.\n\nOnce you integrate the skill sets of both archetypes, you will experience life at a different level from most people. You will operate from a space of bliss, ease, inspiration, and abundance. The Buddha and the Badass: The Secret Spiritual Art of Succeeding at Work will show you how.

The entire nation had seen a videotape of the beating, so when a jury failed to convict the officers, their acquittal triggered widespread outrage and six days of rioting in Los Angeles. Fifty three people were killed and more than seven thousand buildings were torched. Much of the mayhem was carried live by news cameras from helicopters circling overhead. After a particularly horrific act of violence against a white truck driver, King was moved to make his appeal for peace.\nKing’s appeal is now so overused that it has become cultural kitsch, a catch phrase more often said for laughs then as a serious plea for mutual understanding. I therefore hesitated to use King’s words as the opening line of this book, but I decided to go ahead, for two reasons. First, because most Americans nowadays are asking King’s question, not about race relations but about political relations and the collapse of cooperation across party lines. Many Americans feel as though the nightly news from Washington is sent to us from helicopters circling over the city–dispatches from the war zone.\nThe second reason I decided to open this book with an overused phrase is because King followed it up with something lovely, something rarely quoted. As he stumbled through his television interview, fighting back tears and often repeating himself, he found these words: “Please, we can get along here. We all can get along. I mean, we’re all stuck here for a while. Let’s try to work it out.”\nThis book is about why it’s so hard for us to get along. We are indeed all stuck here for a while, so while we’re waiting, let’s at least try to understand why we are so easily divided into hostile groups, each one certain of its righteousness."

Its core principles—involvement of the IT function in each phase of a system’s design and development, heavy reliance on automation versus human effort, the application of engineering practices and tools to operations tasks—are consistent with many of SRE’s principles and practices. One could view DevOps as a generalization of several core SRE principles to a wider range of organizations, management structures, and personnel. One could equivalently view SRE as a specific implementation of DevOps with some idiosyncratic extensions.\nSRE and DevOps ask two different but equally valuable questions:\n\nDevOps asks what needs to be done.\nSRE asks how that can be done."

This discussion is accomplished by using the tools and techniques across the company, helping to spread ownership across all employees.\n\n\nAccept failure as normal SREs need to make sure that there aren’t too many errors or failures. To do so, they use a formula composed of SLI and SLO scores. SLIs count failures per request, by calculating request latency, throughput of requests per second, or failures per request per time. SLOs are derived from threshold and percentage, and represent the success of SLIs over a certain amount of time.\n\n\nImplement gradual change SREs are all in for change, but in a slow, methodical way. Because companies want to move faster, they demand frequent releases, continually updating the product. So DevOps and SREs must respond quickly but maintain a steady, controlled pace.\n\n\nLeverage tooling and automation Automate as long as it provides value to developers and operations by removing manual tasks.\n\n\nMeasure everything SRE teams need to know that everything is moving in the right direction.

It is characterized by the following: decreased metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of breathing; a decrease or “calming” in brain activity; an increase in attention and decision-making functions of the brain; and changes in gene activity that are the opposite of those associated with stress.”\nThe relaxation response. As Benson says above, it’s basically the opposite of the fight-or-flight response that most of us spend way too much of our time in these days. Our bodies are brilliantly architected in such a way that, when faced with a life-threatening danger, all systems necessary for our survival are activated: from our hearts pumping blood to our legs so we can make a quick exit to adrenalin flooding our system so we’re as strong as possible for a potential fight.\nNow, back in the day when we needed to worry about saber-tooth tigers having us for lunch, that fight-or-flight response mechanism was pretty sweet. Unfortunately, our body’s evolution hasn’t quite kept up with our mind’s evolution and now a sideways glance from our boss or someone cutting us off in traffic often elicits the same response. All. Day. Long. That constant barrage takes a significant toll on our well-being. And, researchers have discovered that our ability to induce its opposite relaxation response is huge.\n\n\nSummary\nEnhancing Your Personal Health Through the Science and Genetics of Mind Body Healing\n\nSummary by Philosophers Notes Brian Johnson"

You’ll become familiar with how Quarkus works with the wider Java ecosystem and discover ways to adapt this framework to your particular needs.\n\nWe said that Quarkus is meant to run within Kubernetes. That sounds great, but we know lots of things can run within Kubernetes. Throw your application in a Docker container, and it will run on Kubernetes. While this is true, there are a number of things that traditionally have to be done to properly tune, size, and configure your application to run efficiently within Kubernetes. You also have to pull out your text editor of choice and craft multiple YAML files—and let’s be honest, no one really enjoys doing all that."

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.\nIn this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love—to transform their lives and your own."

Now and for the foreseeable future:\n\nGrowth will be slower. But the company that executes well will have the confidence, speed, and resources to move fast as new opportunities emerge.\nCompetition will be fiercer, with companies searching for any possible advantage in every area from products and technologies to location and management.\nGovernments will take on new roles in their national economies, some as partners to business, others imposing constraints. Companies that execute well will be more attractive to government entities as partners and suppliers and better prepared to adapt to a new wave of regulation.\nRisk management will become a top priority for every leader. Execution gives you an edge in detecting new internal and external threats and in weathering crises that can never be fully predicted.\n\nExecution shows how to link together people, strategy, and operations, the three core processes of every business. Leading these processes is the real job of running a business, not formulating a “vision” and leaving the work of carrying it out to others.\nBossidy and Charan show the importance of being deeply and passionately engaged in an organization and why robust dialogues about people, strategy, and operations result in a business based on intellectual honesty and realism."

You can do all the planning of components like networking, instances, and security with infrastructure as a code. Once done, you can push it into your dev ecosystem. It becomes easy to test and prod as you promote them in the dev environment and consistently repeat these steps.\nDevOps tools and culture are to work together to achieve supply development with continuous delivery.

DevOps practices, such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery, are used to drive microservice deployments.\nMicroservices nicely complement cloud-based application architectures by allowing software development teams to take advantage of scenarios such as event-driven programming and autoscale. The microservice components expose APIs (application programming interfaces), typically over REST protocols, for communicating with other services.\nAn increasingly common practice is to use container clusters to implement microservices.

    "text": "2 What DevOps Isn’t\nGiven that DevOps is a philosophy… a management approach… and the combination of multiple IT disciplines… it might be easier to quickly look at some of what it isn’t.\n\nDevOps is not Agile. That said, your teams might indeed use Agile as a development methodology within an overall DevOps-style approach. Agile is certainly DevOps-compatible, and, like DevOps, values short, continual improvement.\nDevOps is not Continuous Integration. That said, CI is often a part of DevOps-style behavior. The two can be really closely related, in fact - so closely that it’s hard to tell the difference. I suppose you could argue that it’s difficult to practice the DevOps philosophy without using CI as an enabling implementation, but you can definitely have CI without behaving like a DevOps organization, so the two aren’t exactly the same thing.\nDevOps isn’t “the developers running Operations.” If anything, it’s Operations automating things to the point where Operations runs itself in response to authorized actions taken by other roles, including developers.\nDevOps isn’t a software development methodology. See the first bullet, above. DevOps is what happens while software development is happening, and largely what happens when software development (or a cycle of it), is done. You still need to manage your software development - you just need to use a methodology that’s DevOps-compatible.\nDevOps is not automation. However, you can’t have DevOps without automation. Automation is perhaps the biggest thing that Operations brings to the DevOps table, in fact.\n\n\nFurther, it actually seems to be an unstated goal of many DevOps champions to avoid the creation of any kind of trademarked, rigid, rulebook of “how to do DevOps,” as ITIL or TQM or something. This book certainly doesn’t attempt to provide “rules;” the goal here is to provide some understanding of what DevOps’ broad goals are.\n\nDevOps by DevOps Training"

    "text": "2 Fundamentals\n\n\n\nSpring Boot\n\n\nSpring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, which is a Java-based framework for building enterprise applications. Some of the key concepts of Spring Boot and how it functions include:\n\nBeans: In Spring, a bean is a Java object that is managed by the Spring container. Beans are typically defined in configuration files, and the Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing the lifecycle of these beans.\nDependency Injection: Spring uses dependency injection to manage the dependencies between beans. This means that instead of instantiating and configuring dependencies manually, you can use annotations or configuration files to tell the Spring container which dependencies a bean has and how they should be instantiated.\nObject-Oriented Programming: Spring is based on object-oriented programming principles, and it uses interfaces and inheritance to create a modular and reusable codebase.\nAspect-Oriented Programming: Spring also provides support for Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), which allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management from the core business logic of your application.\nData Access: Spring Boot provides a set of starters and libraries for connecting to databases and performing data access operations. It also provides support for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks such as Hibernate and JPA.\nWeb Development: Spring Boot provides a set of starters and libraries for building web applications and RESTful web services. It also provides support for web technologies such as Spring MVC and Thymeleaf.\nAnnotations: Spring Boot uses annotations extensively to configure beans and manage dependencies. Understanding the different annotations available in Spring, such as @Bean, @Autowired, and @Component, can help you effectively use the framework.\nMVC (Model-View-Controller): Spring Boot provides support for the MVC architectural pattern, which separates the application into three layers: the model (data), the view (presentation), and the controller (logic). Understanding how MVC works in Spring Boot can help you structure your application effectively.\nREST (Representational State Transfer): Spring Boot provides support for building RESTful web services. Understanding the principles of REST and how to create RESTful web services using Spring Boot can help you effectively use the framework.\n\nOverall, Spring Boot functions by providing a set of pre-configured options and defaults, as well as a set of tools for quickly creating and running an application using the Spring Framework.\nIt uses concepts such as beans, dependency injection, and OOP to make it easy to build and run a Spring-based application, with minimal configuration and setup required.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Spring MVC \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Spring Boot: create a Spring Boot Project"

JPA is a standard API for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and provides a way to map Java objects to relational databases.\n\n\nIn Spring Boot, JPA is used to interact with databases. It provides a convenient and powerful way to perform CRUD operations on database tables and provides a lot of useful features such as caching, lazy loading, and automatic management of transaction.\nSpring Boot provides a number of auto-configuration options for JPA, so you don’t have to set up everything from scratch. The spring-boot-starter-data-jpa is a starter for using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate. It provides a convenient way to create JPA repositories, which can be used to perform CRUD operations on the database.\nWhen using JPA in Spring Boot, you can use the @Entity annotation to define a class as a JPA entity, and the @Repository annotation to define a class as a JPA repository.

It is an architectural style for building web services that are designed to be lightweight, stateless, and easy to scale.\n\n\nIn Spring Boot, the Spring MVC framework is used to build RESTful web services. The @RestController annotation is used to define a class as a RESTful web service controller. This annotation is a combination of the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations, which means that the class is a controller and the methods return the data directly rather than returning the name of a view.\nThe @RequestMapping annotation is used to map HTTP requests to specific methods in a controller class. This annotation can be used at the class level or the method level to define the path that the method should handle.\nIn addition to these annotations, Spring Boot also provides a number of other features that make it easy to build RESTful web services, such as support for JSON and XML serialization and deserialization, automatic content negotiation, and built-in exception handling.\nIn summary, REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

With such features, H2 can be used for rapid prototype development,testing purpose or embedded in Java applications.\n\nH2 Java DataBase"

In other words, it is a way to manage the dependencies between objects in a software application.\nIn Spring Boot, the dependency injection is provided by the Spring Framework. The Spring container is responsible for creating and managing the objects in the application, and it uses dependency injection to provide the objects with their dependencies.\nThere are two types of dependency injection: Constructor injection and setter injection.\n\nConstructor injection: The dependencies are provided to the class through its constructor.\nSetter injection: The dependencies are provided to the class through setter methods.\n\nWith dependency injection, objects are no longer responsible for creating or managing their dependencies, which makes the code more maintainable and easier to test.\nThe @Autowired annotation is used in Spring Boot to automatically wire a bean from the Spring application context into a class field or method. This allows you to use dependency injection to provide objects with their dependencies without having to manually create or manage them.\nIn summary, Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies from external sources rather than creating them internally.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit quarto.org.\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text in a way that is easy to read and write. It is commonly used on the web to format blog posts and other types of content.\nVisualCode is an integrated development environment (IDE) that is used to write and debug code.\nGitHub Pages is a service offered by the popular version control platform GitHub. It allows users to create and host websites using the files that are stored in their GitHub repositories. It can be used to create personal, organization, or project-based websites.\n\n\nGit\nGit is a version control system that is used for tracking changes to files, such as source code or documents. It is commonly used by software developers to manage their codebase, but it can also be used for other types of files.\n\nGit allows users to create a repository, which is a collection of files that are managed by Git. Each time a change is made to a file in the repository, Git records the change in a new version of the file. This allows users to easily undo changes, compare different versions of a file, and collaborate with others on the same files.\n\nGit also provides tools for managing and merging changes made by different users. This makes it possible for multiple people to work on the same files at the same time without overwriting each other’s changes.\nOverall, Git is a powerful and widely-used tool that is essential for anyone working on large or complex projects with multiple collaborators. It allows users to easily track, manage, and share changes to their files, making it easier to develop and maintain software projects."

To do this, follow these steps:\n\nOpen the repository on GitHub and go to the “Settings” tab.\nScroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section and select the “master branch” as the source for your website.\nGitHub will automatically build and publish your website, and it will provide a URL where you can view it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful: these instructions are just a general overview\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that these instructions are just a general overview of how to use VisualCode and GitHub together. There are many other features and options that you can use to customize your workflow. For more detailed information, you can consult the documentation for VisualCode and GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown examples\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format text in a way that is easy to read and write. It is commonly used on the web to format blog posts and other types of content.\nTo format text using Markdown, you use special characters and symbols to indicate the formatting that you want to apply. For example, to create a heading, you can use the # symbol followed by the text of the heading. To create a bullet list, you can use the - symbol at the beginning of each list item.\nHere is an example of how Markdown can be used to format a simple document, when this Markdown code is rendered, it will look like this::\n\nHeading 5\nThis is a paragraph of text. It can include italicized or bold text, and you can create links to other web pages.\n\nThis is a bullet list\nEach item in the list begins with a dash\nYou can nest lists by indenting the items\n\n\nThis is a blockquote To create a blockquote, you use the > symbol at the beginning of each line\n\nfunction Comment(props) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"Comment\">\n      <div className=\"UserInfo\">\n        <img className=\"Avatar\"\n          src={props.author.avatarUrl}\n          alt={props.author.name}\n        />\n        <div className=\"UserInfo-name\">\n          {props.author.name}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"Comment-text\">\n        {props.text}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"Comment-date\">\n        {formatDate(props.date)}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\nThere are many other features and options available in Markdown, and you can use it to format your text in a variety of ways. For more information, you can consult the documentation for the specific implementation of Markdown that you are using."

    "text": "2 Jim Kwik: learn anything faster\nTo learn anything faster, just remember FAST\n\n2.1 The F in Fast stands for Forget\n\nIf you want to speed up ‘kwik brain,’ you must temporarily forget three things.\nForget what you already know about the subject. A lot of people don’t learn faster because they feel like they already know the information. But your mind is like a parachute—it only works when it’s open.\nForget about anything that’s not urgent and important. You can’t multitask. If your brain is thinking about 4 different things, you’re not fully present and you won’t learn ’kwik’ly.\nForget your limitations. These are beliefs like your memory isn’t good, or you’re a slow reader, or you don’t have the right education to learn. But if you fight for your limitations, you get to keep them. Your memory isn’t fixed, and it is possible to remember hundreds of words and numbers the way I do onstage.\n\n\n\n2.2 The A in FAST stands for Active\n\nIn school, we were taught to learn by consuming information quietly. But you don’t learn by being lectured to. You learn by creating information and being active in the process.\nLearning is NOT a spectator sport.\nHow can you be more active in your learning?\nAsk questions.\nTake notes.\nThe more active you are, the more you will learn.\n\n\n\n2.3 The S in FAST stands for State\n\nYour state is a snapshot of your mood – the mood of your mind and your body. It’s the emotional well-being that you feel in that exact moment.\nInformation combined with emotion becomes a long-term memory.\nMany of us don’t remember what we learned in school because the umbrella emotion for most people in school was boredom.\nYou are the only person in control of your state.\nHow can you improve your state?\nChange your posture or your body or breathing.\nSit or stand the way you would if you were totally energized.\nThink about how you’ll benefit from the information.\nAll learning is state-dependent. Choose states of joy, fascination, and curiosity.\nSell your cleverness for bewilderment – Rumi.\n\n\n\n2.4 The T in FAST stands for Teach\n\nIf you want to cut your learning curve in half, learn with the intention of teaching it to somebody else.\nIf you had to give a presentation on what you’re learning today, you would learn it differently. You would pay closer attention. You would take more detailed notes. You would ask better questions.\nWhen I teach something, I get to learn it twice.\nPeople often say that those who can’t do teach. But I never saw that as a negative. I always thought, wow, if I can’t do something, I can teach it, and then I can do it.\n\n\n\n2.5 References: Learning How to Learn\n\nThis course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines.\n\n\nWe’ll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates chunks information.\n\n\nWe’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.\n\n\nLearning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects: Learning How to Learn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About images credit \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n About Writing"

Besides, they play a crucial role in facilitating communication and understanding.\nThese words are often used to ask open-ended questions, which are questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Asking open-ended questions allows for more in-depth conversation and debate and can help to uncover important information or insights.\nFor example,\n\nasking “Why did this happen?” can help to identify the underlying causes of a particular event,\nwhile asking “What are the consequences of this decision?” can help to anticipate and evaluate the potential impacts of a choice.\n\nOverall, asking why, who, what, and how can help to improve communication, to facilitate decision-making, and to deepen understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  A(Why: programming) --> |Very personal question\\n and it must be answered| B{Who: profiles}\n  B--> C(You love it) \n  B--> D(You need it)\n  C--> E(What: sylabus)\n  H[\"Here you need some\\n kind of guidence\"]--> |teacher?senior? \\nif not a 'picar pedra'| E(What: sylabus)\n  D--> E(What: sylabus)\n  E--> |The what is helpless\\n if you don't know the for| F(For What: skills)\n  F--> |The most second most importat step\\n after the why, the how\\n a bad how may destroy your why| G(How: \\nlearning techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About Writing Comments \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Books Card-Listing"

Each paragraph should be about an individual topic or speech. Begin paragraphs with a sentence that gives the topic or helps with the transition. Break paragraphs apart if it helps the reader, not just for the hell of it.\n\n‘After the paragraph has been written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.’ (Page 32)\n\nActive voice - it’s much better to use the active voice in most cases. E.g.:\n\n\n‘A report was prepared,’ is not as good as;\n‘He prepared a report.’\n\n\nNot - say what things are. Don’t waste your time saying what they are not.\n\n\nBe definite - do not dance around the truth express it in concrete terms.\n\n\nOmit needless words - ‘this is a subject that’ can better be written as ‘this subject’.\n\n\nSummaries and Tenses - in a summary, or anywhere really, pick a tense and stick to it, otherwise you’ll confuse the reader.\n\n\nEmphasis - put the word or words you want to emphasise at the end of a sentence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  About learning \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n About Taking Notes"

My fields of expertise are … let’s OpenAI introduce them:\n\nA software architect is a person who is responsible for the overall design and architecture of a software system. They are responsible for creating a high-level design that defines the structure and behavior of the system, as well as for ensuring that the system meets the needs and requirements of the user or client.\n\n\nA team leader is a person who is responsible for leading and managing a team of individuals. They are responsible for setting goals and objectives for the team, as well as for providing guidance and support to team members. A team leader may also be responsible for coordinating the work of the team, monitoring progress, and providing feedback to team members.\n\n\nA professor is an individual who teaches at a college or university. They typically have advanced degrees in their field of expertise and are responsible for designing and delivering courses, conducting research, and providing academic guidance to students.\n\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who starts and runs their own business. They are responsible for identifying a business opportunity, developing a business plan, and managing the day-to-day operations of the business. An entrepreneur is typically focused on growing the business and generating profits, and they may also be involved in product development, marketing, and other aspects of the business.\n\n\nThese four roles are all different and may be held by different individuals. A software architect is focused on the technical design and implementation of a software system, a team leader is focused on managing and coordinating the work of a team, a professor is focused on teaching and research in a particular field of study, and an entrepreneur is focused on starting and running a business.\n\n\nContact\n\nprofessor:  professor (albertprofe at gmail dot com)\nprofessional:  professinal (ayarza at inspiratgames dot com)\n\n\n\nLinkedin\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-yarza-demur/  \n\n\n\n  IFCD0210 Projects Backlog \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n About this site"

    "text": "📘 SCRUM definition\nScrum is a framework for project management that is based on teamwork, accountability, transparency and short time-boxed iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.\nThe framework begins with a simple premise: start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and adapt, whenever it is necessary.\nAt the end of each iteration, the team holds two meetings: one review to show the work done for clients and to get feedback, and one retrospective to enable the team to reflect and improve.\n\n\n\n\nScrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.\nScrum itself is a simple framework for effective team collaboration on complex products.\n\n\nScrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.\nThis section contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of:\n\nScrum’s roles,\nevents,\nartifacts,\nand the rules that bind them together.\n\n\nScrum is: Lightweight, Simple to understand and Difficult to master.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scrum Team is made up of the people who actually work on Product Backlog Items during a Sprint. In a software context, this group is most often called the Development Team.\n\n\nIn other contexts, the simple term Team is often used.\nThe Scrum Master and the Product Owner, while part of the overall Scrum Team, may or may not be members of the Team working on PBIs. There is no Project Manager or Team Lead in Scrum.\n\nEveryone is simply an equal member of the Team.\n\nThe Scrum team is:\n\nTranscendent\nAutonomous\nCross-Functional\n\n\n\n\nThe Scrum Master is tasked with making Scrum work. They work intimately with the Team, sometimes as a member. Their primary task is to remove Impediments and guide the team in Scrum practices.\n\n\nThe Scrum Master does whatever it takes to help the team succeed.\nScrum Masters are servant-leaders, not managers. They play the pivotal role of making sure Scrum is practiced well. The Scrum Master is accountable for the Velocity and the Continuous Improvement of the Team.\n\n\n\nThe Product Owner is the Team member who knows what the customer wants and the relative business value of those wants. He or she can then translate the customer’s wants and values back to the Scrum team.\n\n\nThe Product Owner must know the business case for the product and what features the customers wants.\nHe must be available to consult with the team to make sure they are correctly implementing the product vision. Most importantly, he must have the authority to make all decisions necessary to complete the project.\n\n\n\n\nThrough this work we have come to value:\n\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\n\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX is currently using a methodologies pool\n\n\nAt the very beginning, when they were just a startup, they used all Lean Startup tips to achieve the success. They did unscalable things, bought some spares for rockets in usual computer shops, made some spares by themselves, etc.\n\n\nAll of these were a total craziness for classical aerospace companies. But it was the key benefit how they competed mastodons, like Lockheed and Boeing.\nTesting of hypotheses, tight budgets, and continuous innovations made the appreciable contribution to company success.\n\nAll Elon’s companies use Silicon Valley startup approach to achieve success. And this is what distinguishes them among all other classical companies from the industry\n\nPerhaps, it’s not a classical Scrum approach like software companies use, but it’s from the field of Kaizen and The Toyota Way. This is how startups should behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n  ReactJS Resources \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Agile Manifesto"

(and from now on) The Pitt that most likely you would fall into. Trust me, I’ve been there…Actually I AM constantly there, that’s why I want to reflect that in this kind of journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s the tricky part, I don’t know how as of today (01/19/2023). But hopefully I will. First of all you need to understand the concept of iteration, my friend. With that in mind, we just need to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou surely noticed the flowchart above. It’s such a common pattern for us who just started programming. Have you ever feel identified with it?\nAs you keep progressing in your coding lessons, problems are going to be slightly more difficult and complex every time. Until you reach to a point when you can’t completely see the solution in your mind.\nYou’ll probably see straight how to get from A to B, but from B to C you see it blurry… Well, then you just have to get to B so you can see more clear how to get to C better, right?\nYes, I always trick to myself like that…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about Albertus’ Dylemma:\n\n\n\nIt is that moment when you either need to stop, take two steps back and think what led you into this or keep hitting the wall (and the keyboard with your pointless code).\n\n\nI’m going to try to develop that idea on some exercises based on this lab:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📘 Linux Lab#SE02-1: Movie Review and Rating\nCreate a Maven/Gradle Java SE Project.\n\nAdd the needed dependencies:\n    Lombok\n    Junit\n    Java Faker\n\nCreate three Java classes to define the Model. Java SE Classes:\n\n    Movie: The Movie class represents a movie that is being reviewed. It has the following attributes:\n        title: a String representing the title of the movie\n        reviews: a Set of Review objects representing the reviews that have been written for this movie\n        Critic: The Critic class represents a critic who writes reviews.\n\n    The Critic class has the following attributes:\n        name: a String representing the name of the critic\n        Review: The Review class represents a review of a movie written by a critic.\n\n    The Review class has the following attributes:\n        movie: a Movie object representing the movie being reviewed\n        critic: a Critic object representing the critic who wrote the review\n        rating: an int representing the rating given by the critic (on a scale of 1 to 5)\n        comment: a String representing the comment written by the critic about the movie\n\n\n\nSo I have this requirement:\n\nMake a program that can manage information about movies such as:\n\nMovie name.\nIts director (e.g. so I can plan a themed marathon with my friends.)\n\nDirector’s prestige: I want to know how many Oscars has the director won through his career.\n\nIt also needs to include its critics made by the best professionals and to know how well or poorly rated it is.\n\n\nUser Story #1 - The easiest and certain way to hit the wall.\nLet’s just start coding:\n\npublic Class MovieManager  {\n    public static void main(String[])\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\nA[Problema] --> B[Decision]\nB --> C(Code & See)\nB --> D(Piensa)\nD --> E[Sabes lo que haces?]\nC --> G[El Pozo]\nD --> F[Te enamoraste de tu primera idea?]\nG --> A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Week 8: The specialist \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Week 10: Beyond SCRUM"

    "text": "Lifecycle software (2022)\nAnd a developer needs such a set skill due to the wide and integral software lifecycle that allows to build apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process that describes the stages involved in creating and deploying software. It typically includes the following six steps:\n\nPlanning: This stage involves identifying the goals and objectives of the software, as well as determining the resources and timelines required to develop it.\nDesign: In this stage, the software’s architecture and user interface are created, and the functional and non-functional requirements are defined.\nTest: This stage involves the implementation of test-driven development (TDD). It starts by writing automated test cases based on the requirements and design of the software. The developer then writes the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test, and repeat this process until all the requirements are met.\nDevelop: The actual coding of the software takes place during this stage. This may involve writing code in a specific programming language or using certain development tools.\nMaintain: Once the software is tested and developed, it will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, usually by leveraging training environments to detect further errors or defects.\nDeploy: The final stage is deployment, where the software is made available to users. This may involve installing the software on individual computers or deploying it to a server for multiple users to access."

This makes it easier to provision resources as needed for dynamic workloads.\nEfficiency: Hypervisors that run several virtual machines on one physical machine’s resources also allow for more efficient utilization of one physical server. It is more cost- and energy-efficient to run several virtual machines on one physical machine than to run multiple underutilized physical machines for the same task.\nFlexibility: Bare-metal hypervisors allow operating systems and their associated applications to run on a variety of hardware types because the hypervisor separates the OS from the underlying hardware, so the software no longer relies on specific hardware devices or drivers.\nPortability: Hypervisors allow multiple operating systems to reside on the same physical server (host machine). Because the virtual machines that the hypervisor runs are independent from the physical machine, they are portable. IT teams can shift workloads and allocate networking, memory, storage and processing resources across multiple servers as needed, moving from machine to machine or platform to platform. When an application needs more processing power, the virtualization software allows it to seamlessly access additional machines."

Bash is also widely used as a programming language, with a syntax and structure that is similar to other programming languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on bash\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its many features and capabilities, Bash is also highly customizable, with a variety of options and settings that allow users to customize its behavior and appearance. Users can customize their Bash environment by modifying the Bash configuration file, known as the bashrc file, which contains a set of commands and settings that are executed every time Bash is launched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Bourne Again SHell (BASH) by Wikimedia Foundation"

For example, if you are currently logged in as a normal user and you want to run a command as the root user, you can use the su command to switch to the root user and then run the command.\nsudo stands for superuser do, and it allows you to execute a single command with the privileges of another user, usually the root user. It is often used to execute commands that require administrative privileges, such as installing software or making system-wide configuration changes.\n\nBut in Linux Mint sudo is often considered to be a better alternative to su for several reasons, it allows you to execute a single command with administrative privileges, logs all command executions, allows for a more fine-grained control over who can execute which commands, prompts for the user’s password before execution, and is more widely used and supported in the Linux community."

(Lab#LI04-1)\nWrite the bash scripts that implement this functionality. This may involve writing functions to perform specific tasks, as well as handling input and output from the terminal. (Lab#LI04-1)\nTest the scripts to ensure they are working as intended. (Lab#LI04-1)\nPackage the scripts into a single executable file that can be easily run from the terminal. This may involve creating a wrapper script that calls the other scripts in the correct order. (Lab#LI04-2)\nMake the app available for others to use, either by distributing it as a package (such as a .deb or .rpm file) or by hosting it on a website or repository.

It offers a number of features that can help users manage large numbers of Quarto files more efficiently.\nRepository on GitHub\n\n\nQtool is a command-line tool that helps users manage and manipulate their Quarto (.qmd) files. It has the following five operations:\n\ndebug: scans the directories and files in a specified directory, and checks for any discrepancies between the .yaml and .qmd files. It reports any errors or inconsistencies it finds.\ndirtable: generates a CSV file containing information about the directories in the specified directory. It includes the directory name, the number of files in the directory, and the total number of lines in all of the files in the directory.\nyamltable: generates a CSV file containing information about the .yaml files in the specified directory. It includes the file name, the number of lines in the file, and the number of sections in the file.\nwritenavigation: adds callouts to the .qmd files in the specified directory, to make it easier for users to navigate through the content. It adds a callout at the beginning of each section, with a link to the next and previous sections.\n\n\n\n\n_qtool folder on quarto project directory\n\n\n\n\n\nyamltable executing: there are 3 discrepancies on yaml configuration file\n\n\n\n\n\nyamltable: missing .qmd file\n\n\n\n\n\ndirtable executing: all files in our directory\n\n\n\n\n\ndirtable: all data from files\n\n\n\n\n\ndebug executing: summary\n\n\n\n\n\nwritenavigation is will create navigation links and write the .qmd file\n\n\n\n\n\nwritenavigation executinng\n\n\n\n\n\nafter execution writenavigation\n\n\n\n\n\nCode: writenavigation.sh\n\n\nupdated code on GitHub.com\n\n\n\nwritenavigation.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Initialize an empty array\nfiles=()\ntitles=()\n# Initialize a counter variable\ncounter=0\nop_counter=0\n# Generate the log file name using the current date and time\nlog_file=\"$(date +\"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S\")-log-write-navLinks.txt\"\n# Initialize a string variable\npath_qmd=''\ntitle=''\ntitle_line=''\n\n# Open the log file for writing\nexec 3> \"_logs/${log_file}\"\n\necho \"***************** Extracting **********************\" >&3\n\n# Read the input code line by line\nwhile IFS= read -r line;

It is terminated by a semi-colon (;), just like an English sentence is ended with a period, as in Lines 6.\n\n\nblock\nA block is a group of programming statements enclosed by a pair of braces {}. This group of statements is treated as one single unit. There are two blocks in the above program. One contains the body of the class Hello. The other contains the body of the main() method. There is no need to put a semi-colon after the closing brace.\n\n\nwhitespaces\nBlank, tab, and newline are collectively called whitespace. Extra whitespaces are ignored, i.e., only one whitespace is needed to separate the tokens. Nonetheless, extra whitespaces improve the readability, and I strongly suggest you use extra spaces and newlines to improve the readability of your code.\n\n\ncase sensitivity\nJava is case sensitive - a ROSE is NOT a Rose, and is NOT a rose. The filename, which is the same as the class name, is also case-sensitive.\n\n\njava se\ndescription\n\n\ndesign-patterns\ndescription\n\n\njava OOP\ndescription\n\n\njava object\ndescription\n\n\ncoupling\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  DevOps Vocabulary \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Spring Boot Vocabulay"

When a new instance of the Counter class is created, the count field is incremented, and the new value is shared by all instances of the class.\nAnother example:\n\n\nAccount.java\n\npublic class Account {\n    // Static field\n    private static int nextAccountNumber = 1;\n\n    // Private instance variables\n    private int accountNumber;\n    private String name;\n    private double balance;\n\n    // Constructor\n    public Account(String name, double balance) {\n        this.accountNumber = nextAccountNumber++;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    // Getter method for the accountNumber field\n    public int getAccountNumber() {\n        return accountNumber;\n    }\n\n    // Getter method for the name field\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    // Getter method for the balance field\n    public double getBalance() {\n        return balance;\n    }\n\n    // Method for depositing money into the account\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    // Method for withdrawing money from the account\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example, the Account class defines a nextAccountNumber field that is marked as static. This means that the nextAccountNumber field belongs to the Account class itself, rather than to an instance of the Account class. This means that all instances of the Account class share the same value for the nextAccountNumber field.\nWhen a new instance of the Account class is created, the nextAccountNumber field is incremented, and the new value is shared by all instances of the class. This allows each instance of the Account class to have a unique accountNumber field, which is generated automatically using the nextAccountNumber field."

This ensures that only one instance of the class is created, and that all other classes can access this instance easily.\n\n\n\nSingleton Pattern"

This means that instances of the Logger class can only be created from within the Logger class itself.\nThe Logger class also defines a getInstance() method, which is marked as public and static. This method is used to access the instance of the Logger class, and to create the instance if it does not already exist.\nBecause the Logger class is a singleton, there can only be one instance of the class at any given time. This means that all instances of the Logger class share the same instance of the writer field, which is used to write messages to the log file.\nOverall, this example shows how the singleton pattern can be used to implement a Logger class in Java, which ensures that there is only one instance of the Logger class, and provides a global point of access to that instance. This allows the Logger class to manage shared resources, such as the log file, in a more efficient and effective way."

This means that instances of the ConfigurationManager class can only be created from within the ConfigurationManager class itself.\nThe ConfigurationManager class also defines a getInstance() method, which is marked as public and static. This method is used to access the instance of the ConfigurationManager class, and to create the instance if it does not already exist.\nBecause the ConfigurationManager class is a singleton, there can only be one instance of the class at any given time. This means that all instances of the ConfigurationManager class share the same instance of the config field, which is used to store the configuration properties.\nOverall, this example shows how the singleton pattern can be used to implement a ConfigurationManager class in Java, which ensures that there is only one instance of the ConfigurationManager class, and provides a global point of access to that instance. This allows the ConfigurationManager class to manage shared resources, such as the configuration properties, in a more efficient and effective way. \n\n\n\n  Java Patterns: Types \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Creational: Factory"

    "text": "2 Solving discussion\n\n2.1 MovieManager uses Movie\nLet’s grow our code of the MovieManager class by adding two methods: saveToCSV() and deleteCSV().\nThe saveToCSV() method is used to save the movie data stored in the movies HashMap field of the MovieManager class to a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file named movies.csv located in the same directory as the running program. It uses a FileWriter object to write the data to the file.\nThe deleteCSV() method is used to delete a CSV file named movies.csv located in the directory /home/devops/MyProjects/JavaSEProjects/MovieManager/resources/. It uses a File object to represent the file, and the delete() method of the File class to delete the file.\nIf the file is deleted successfully, it prints “File deleted successfully” message, otherwise it prints “Failed to delete the file” message.\n\n\nMovieManager.java\n\nimport lombok.AllArgsConstructor;\nimport lombok.Data;\nimport lombok.NoArgsConstructor;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Date;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\n\npublic class MovieManager {\n    private int qty;\n    private double size;\n    private HashMap<String, Movie> movies;\n    private Date lastModified;\n\n    public MovieManager() {\n       // ...\n    }\n\n    public void addMovie(Movie movie) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n      public Movie getMovie(String title) {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    // this is a mere idea, just a proposal to understand\n    // how it colud be done\n    // iterate the hashMap movies to get each movies\n    // to save file in Linxu\n    //  try (FileWriter writer = \n    // new FileWriter(\"/home/~/movies.csv\")\n    // )\n    public void saveToCSV() {\n        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(\"movies.csv\")) {\n            for (Movie movie : this.movies.values()) {\n                writer.append(movie.getTitle());\n                writer.append(\",\");\n                writer.append(movie.getDirector());\n                writer.append(\",\");\n                writer.append(movie.getGenre());\n                writer.append(\"\\n\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void deleteCSV() {\n    File file = new File(\"/home/~/movies.csv\");\n      if(file.delete()){\n          System.out.println(\"File deleted successfully\");\n      }else{\n          System.out.println(\"Failed to delete the file\");\n      }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIt starts by creating a try-with-resources block, which automatically closes the FileWriter object when the block finishes executing. Then it loops through the values() of the movies HashMap, which gives an iterable collection of Movie objects.\n\nFor each Movie object, it appends the title, director and genre information separated by commas, and then a newline character. This creates a CSV file with each line representing a movie, in the format of: title,director,genre.\n\nIt’s worth noting that this code is just an example, and it will work correctly if the file exists at the specified location. If the file doesn’t exist, the delete method will return false and the message “Failed to delete the file” will be printed.\n\nAlso the path of csv file is hardcoded and it may change on different systems so it’s better to make it dynamic or keep it in configuration file.\n\n\n\nThis diagram shows that the MovieManager class uses the Movie class, and the arrow points from MovieManager to Movie.\nThis indicates that MovieManager class is dependent on Movie class and it uses it as a data structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n class MovieManager {\n    -int qty\n    -double size\n    -HashMap<String, Movie> movies\n    -Date lastModified\n    +addMovie(Movie movie)\n    +updateMovie(String title, Movie movie)\n    +deleteMovie(String title)\n    +getMovie(String title)\n    +saveToCSV()\n    }\n    class Movie{\n    +String title\n    +String director\n    +String genre\n    +double size\n    +getSize()\n    }\n\n    MovieManager --> Movie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 MovieManager static methods\nIn Java SE, methods can be either static or non-static.\nMaking a method static or non-static affects the way it can be called and how it accesses the fields and methods of a class.\n\n\nMovieManager.java\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Date;\n\npublic class MovieManager {\n    private static HashMap<String, Movie> movies = new HashMap<>();\n    private static int qty = 0;\n    private static double size = 0;\n    private static Date lastModified = new Date();\n\n    public static void addMovie(String title, \n                                String director, String genre, double size) {\n        Movie movie = new Movie(title, director, genre, size);\n        movies.put(title, movie);\n        qty++;\n        size += movie.getSize();\n        lastModified = new Date();\n    }\n\n    public static void updateMovie(String title, \n                                   String director, String genre, double size) {\n        Movie movie = movies.get(title);\n        if (movie != null) {\n            movie.setDirector(director);\n            movie.setGenre(genre);\n            movie.setSize(size);\n            lastModified = new Date();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void deleteMovie(String title) {\n        if (movies.containsKey(title)) {\n            size -= movies.get(title).getSize();\n            movies.remove(title);\n            qty--;\n            lastModified = new Date();\n        }\n    }\n \n}"

The object’s behavior is defined by the methods that operate on its attributes, and these methods can be invoked by other code to ask the object to perform a specific action.\n\n\n\nJava SE Basic Principles OOP Class and Object\n\n\n\n\nObjects are an essential concept in object-oriented programming, and they are used to model real-world entities in a program. For example, you could create an object to represent a particular person, with attributes such as name, age, and address, and methods that operate on these attributes, such as a method to calculate their age in a particular year.\nIn Java, you can create objects by using the new keyword and the class constructor to allocate memory for the object, and then you can access the object’s attributes and methods by using the . (dot) operator. For example, if you have a class called Person, you could create an object of that class like this:\nPerson carla = new Person();\nAnd then you could access the object’s attributes and methods like this:\ncarla.name = \"Carla Whitesand\";\ncarla.setAddress(\"123 Main Street\");\nint age = carla.calc>ulateAge(2022);\n\n\nIn this example, name and setAddress() are attributes and methods of the Person class, and person is an object of that class. You can use this object to store and manipulate data according to the rules defined by the class."

    "text": "3 Creating Objects\nfrom The Java™ Tutorials\nAs you know, a class provides the blueprint for objects; you create an object from a class. Each of the following statements taken from the CreateObjectDemo program creates an object and assigns it to a variable:\nPoint originOne = new Point(23, 94);\nRectangle rectOne = new Rectangle(originOne, 100, 200);\nRectangle rectTwo = new Rectangle(50, 100);\nThe first line creates an object of the Point class, and the second and third lines each create an object of the Rectangle class.\nEach of these statements has three parts (discussed in detail below):\n\nDeclaration: The code set in bold are all variable declarations that associate a variable name with an object type.\nInstantiation: The new keyword is a Java operator that creates the object.\nInitialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.\n\n\n3.1 Declaring a Variable to Refer to an Object\nPreviously, you learned that to declare a variable, you write:\ntype name;\nThis notifies the compiler that you will use name to refer to data whose type is type. With a primitive variable, this declaration also reserves the proper amount of memory for the variable.\nYou can also declare a reference variable on its own line. For example:\nPoint originOne;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a reference variable: is empty\n\n\n\nIf you declare originOne like this, its value will be undetermined until an object is actually created and assigned to it. Simply declaring a reference variable does not create an object.\n\n\nFor that, you need to use the new operator, as described in the next section. You must assign an object to originOne before you use it in your code. Otherwise, you will get a compiler error.\nA variable in this state, which currently references no object, can be illustrated as follows (the variable name, originOne, plus a reference pointing to nothing):\noriginOne –> null\n\n\n\n“originOne –> null” figure part 1"

The new operator also invokes the object constructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstantiating a class\n\n\n\nThe phrase “instantiating a class” means the same thing as “creating an object.” When you create an object, you are creating an “instance” of a class, therefore “instantiating” a class.\nThe new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate.\n\n\nThe new operator returns a reference to the object it created. This reference is usually assigned to a variable of the appropriate type, like:\nPoint originOne = new Point(23, 94);\noriginOne –> Point object\n\n\n\n“originOne –> Point object” figure part 2\n\n\nThe reference returned by the new operator does not have to be assigned to a variable. It can also be used directly in an expression. For example:\nint height = new Rectangle().height;\nThis statement will be discussed in the next section or you can go here.\n\n4.1 Initializing an Object\nHere’s the code for the Point class:\npublic class Point {\n    public int x = 0;\n    public int y = 0;\n    //constructor\n    public Point(int a, int b) {\n        x = a;\n        y = b;\n    }\n}\nThis class contains a single constructor. You can recognize a constructor because its declaration uses the same name as the class and it has no return type.\nThe constructor in the Point class takes two integer arguments, as declared by the code (int a, int b). The following statement provides 23 and 94 as values for those arguments: Linux Lab#LI01-1: Export env user with grep and pipe\nPoint originOne = new Point(23, 94);\n\n\n4.2 Example UML: class and object\n\n\n\nThe class body may contain member variables, constructors, public methods, private helper methods and others."

For example:Implicit casting\n\nPerson carla = new Person(\"Carla\", 30, \"123 Main St.\");\n\nUsing the clone() method: if you want to create a copy of an existing object, you can use the clone() method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method is defined in the java.lang.Object class, which is the superclass of all Java classes. To use the clone() method, you’ll need to implement the Cloneable interface in your class and override the clone() method.\n\n\n\n\nUsing factory methods: A factory method is a static method that returns an instance of a class. Factory methods are often used to create objects when you need more flexibility or control over the object creation process.\nUsing reflection: Reflection is a feature of the Java language that allows you to inspect and manipulate the structure of a class at runtime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use reflection to create objects by invoking the newInstance() method on the Constructor object for a particular class.\n\n\n\n\nUsing object deserialization: You can use object deserialization to create an object from its serialized form, which is a stream of bytes that represents the object’s state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, you’ll need to implement the Serializable interface in your class and use the ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes to serialize and deserialize the object."

    "text": "6 Casting (typecasting)\nCasting is the process of converting one type of data to another type. There are two types of casting: explicit and implicit.\n\n6.1 Explicit casting\nExplicit casting is when you specify the type you want the data to be converted to. An example of explicit casting is:\nint x = (int) 3.14;\nIn this case, the double value of 3.14 is being explicitly cast to an int.\n\n\n6.2 Implicit casting\nImplicit casting, also known as widening, is when the conversion happens automatically without the need for a specific type to be specified. An example of implicit casting is:\ndouble x = 3;\n\n\nIt’s important to note that casting can cause data loss if the type being converted to cannot hold the value of the original type. For example, casting a large double value to an int would result in the decimal places being truncated and lost.\nIn this case, the int value of 3 is being implicitly cast to a double.\n\n\n6.3 Casting in compilation/execution time\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to consider the class of the object and the type of its reference variable when casting, as it can affect both the compilation time and execution time of a program.\n\n\n\nDuring compilation, the compiler checks the source code for any type errors and other issues related to casting, such as trying to cast an object to a class that it is not compatible with. If any errors are found, the compiler will display them and the program will not be able to run until they are fixed. This means that understanding the class of an object and the type of its reference variable is crucial for avoiding casting errors during compilation.\n\n\n\nCompilation time refers to the period of time during which the source code of a program is translated into machine code by a compiler. This is the initial phase of program execution.\n\nAt execution time, casting can also have an impact on the performance and behavior of a program. For example, if a program tries to cast an object to a type that is not compatible with its class, a runtime exception will be thrown, causing the program to crash.\n\n\n\nExecution time refers to the period of time during which the compiled program runs and performs its intended operations. This is the phase of the program when it’s executed by the CPU and its instructions are executed.\nOn the other hand, if the casting is done properly and the object is compatible with the target type, it can improve the performance and efficiency of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nKnowing the class of an object and the type of its reference variable is also important for making sure the program is using the right methods and properties of the object, and for avoiding unexpected behavior.\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Upcasting and downcasting\nBefore reading this section you must read and understand how does inherence work\n\n\n\nA process of converting one data type to another is known as Casting (typecasting) and Upcasting and Downcasting defines weather it is up or down in a inherence relationship\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Upcasting\nUpcasting is casting a subtype to a supertype, upward to the inheritance tree. Upcasting happens automatically and we don’t have to explicitly do anything.\n\n\nTypeCasrting.java\n\n// Base Class\npublic class Animal\n{\n    public void talk() { System.out.println(\"I am talking\"); }\n}\n// Inherited class\nclass Cat extends Animal\n{\n    // This method overrides show() of Parent\n    @Override\n    public void talk() { System.out.println(\"Miauuu, miauuuu, miauuu!!!\"); }\n}\n \npublic class Test\n{\n    public void testUpCasting(){\n    \n        Animal cat = new Cat();\n        cat.talk();\n        // output: Miauuu, miauuuu, miauuu!!!)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n6.6 Downcasting\nWhen Subclass type refers to the object of Parent class, it is known as downcasting. If we perform it directly, compiler gives Compilation error. If you perform it by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime (sometimes we may use instanceof operator, then downcasting is possible)\n\n\nTypeCasrting.java\n\n// Base Class\npublic class Animal\n{\n    public void talk() { System.out.println(\"I am talking\"); }\n}\n// Inherited class\nclass Cat extends Animal\n{\n    // This method overrides show() of Parent\n    @Override\n    public void talk() { System.out.println(\"Miauuu, miauuuu, miauuu!!!\"); }\n}\n \npublic class Test\n{\n    public void testDownCasting(){\n\n        Cat cat = new Animal();\n        // compiling time error, try to cast but it can not\n        Animal animal = new Animal();\n        // creatng an object of the superclass is ok\n        Cat cat = (Cat) animal;\n        // downcasting\n        cat.talk();\n        // output: Miauuu, miauuuu, miauuu!!!)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Java SE: JUnit and TDD \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Java SE: Scope"

    "text": "1 Overview\n\n\n\nStream I/O in Standard I/O (java.io Package)\n\n\n\n\nPackage java.io, provides for system input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system.\n\nFollowing are the important classes in Java.io package:\n\nProgramming simple I/O operations is easy, which involves only a few classes and methods. You could do it by looking at a few samples like our previous lab.\nProgramming efficient, portable I/O is extremely difficult, especially if you have to deal with different character sets.\n\n1.1 Stream\nA stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes. It’s called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.\nIn our app, java.io will create three streams automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.\n\nSystem.out: standard output stream\nSystem.in: standard input stream\nSystem.err: standard error stream\n\n\n\n\nInputStream and OutputStream\n\n\n\n\nInput stream refers to an ordered flow of data in the form of bytes. This flow of data can be coming from various resources such as files, network programs, input devices, etc.\n\nIn order to read such data, we have a Java InputStream Class in the Java IO API. Link\n\n\n\n1.2 Discuss solution\nThese lines of pseudo-code, particulary the (2) line, are the key-solution to use InputStream to simulate a input console.\n(1) String simulateInputByConsole = \"Here\\ngoes\\nhe\\nsimulate\\nimput\";\n(2) InputStream in <<<<< simulateInputByConsole.getBytes();\n(3) System.setIn(in);\nIt creates an InputStream in that reads from a byte array containing the bytes of the input string input.getBytes() (using the platform’s default charset), which allow us to use this InputStream as regular input stream into System.in.\n\n\n\nIt extends the InputStream abstract class.\n\n\nA new InputStream object is being created by wrapping a ByteArrayInputStream around a byte array.\nString input = \"The Shawshank Redemption\\n\" +\nInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(input.getBytes());\n\n\nA ByteArrayInputStream is a subclass of InputStream that reads data from a byte array.\nThe byte array is created by calling the getBytes() method on the input string. getBytes() is a method of the String class that returns a byte array containing the characters of the string encoded using the platform’s default charset.\n\n\n1.3 getBytes()\n    String myString = \"I love Java\";\n    byte[] byteArray;\n\n    // convert the string to a byte array\n    // using platform's default charset\n    byteArray = myString.getBytes();\n    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(byteArray));\n\n    // Output\n    // [73, 32, 108, 111, 118, 101, 32, 74, 97, 118, 97]\n\n\nWe have used the Arrays class in the above example to print the byte array in a readable form. It has nothing to do with getBytes().\nHTML Encoding Character Set\nmore examples\nThere are many other standard charset like:\n\nUS-ASCII: Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a. ISO646-US, a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set\nISO-8859-1: ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1\nUTF-8: Eight-bit UCS Transformation Format\nUTF-16BE: Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, big-endian byte order\nUTF-16LE: Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, little-endian byte order\nUTF-16: Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark.\n\n\n\n1.4 ByteArrayInputStream\nClass ByteArrayInputStream\n   // Creates a ByteArrayInputStream that reads entire array\n   ByteArrayInputStream input = new ByteArrayInputStream(byte[] arr);\nThe ByteArrayInputStream class of the java.io package ìs used to read an array of input data (in bytes).\nmore on ByteArrayInputStream"

Let’s say we are building a class that represents a simple calculator.\nNext, we would run the test to see if it fails. Since we have not yet implemented the add method, the test should fail with a message indicating that the add method is not yet implemented.\nNext, we would write the code for the add method. Here is an example of how this method might look:\n\n\nMyFirstJUnitJupiterTests.java\n\npublic class Calculator {\n\n  public double add(double a, double b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n\n}\n\n\n\nWe want the calculator to have methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two numbers.\nFinally, we would run the test again to ensure that it passes. If the test passes, we know that the add method is working correctly and we can move on to the next feature. We would repeat this process for each of the calculator’s methods, writing a test for each one, implementing the code, and then running the test to ensure it passes.\nThis is just one example of how TDD can be applied in a Java project using JUnit. There are many other ways to approach TDD, and the specific steps and details will vary depending on the project and the requirements."

We then accumulate the odd numbers in the sum variable using the += operator. Finally, we print the result using System.out.println()."

    "text": "4 Streams\n\nFirst of all, Java 8 Streams should not be confused with Java I/O streams (ex: FileInputStream etc).\nSimply put, streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and making bulk processing convenient and fast by lazy and terminal operations.\nA stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. It also never modifies the underlying data source.\nThis functionality java.util.stream supports functional-style operations on streams of elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nStreams allow you to express complex data manipulations in a simple, concise way. With streams, you can filter, map, reduce, and collect data in a highly readable and maintainable way.\n\n\n\n4.1 Example\nHere’s an example of how lazy evaluation, wrapping the data and intermediate/terminal operations work in Java streams:\nList<String> words = Arrays.asList(\"hello\", \"world\", \"how\", \"are\", \"you\");\n\n// create a stream and apply intermediate operations to filter and map the data\nStream<String> stream = words.stream()\n    .filter(w -> w.length() > 3)\n    .map(String::toUpperCase);\n\n// call a terminal operation to evaluate the stream and produce a result\nString result = stream.findFirst().orElse(\"\");\n\nSystem.out.println(result);\n\n\nIn this example, we start by creating a list of strings and then create a stream from the list using the stream() method and wrapping them around.\nWe then apply two intermediate operations, filter() and map(), to filter the words that have a length greater than 3 and convert them to uppercase, respectively.\nAt this point, no computation has been performed on the data. Instead, the operations on the stream have created a new stream with the modified data.\nNext, we call a terminal operation, findFirst(), to find the first element in the stream that matches the specified condition.\nThis operation triggers the computation of the stream and produces a result, which in this case is the first word in the stream that has a length greater than 3 and is in uppercase.\nBecause of lazy evaluation, only the elements that are necessary to produce the result are processed. In this example, only the first element that matches the condition is processed, and the remaining elements are not processed.\nFinally, we print the result to the console, which is the first word in the stream that matches the condition. In this case, the result is the string “WORLD”."

    "text": "5 Optional\n\nOptional is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. It is a way to represent a value that may or may not be present, without using null references.\n\n\nAn Optional object can either contain a non-null value, or be empty. When an Optional object contains a value, it provides a way to safely access that value without risking a NullPointerException. On the other hand, when an Optional object is empty, it indicates that there is no value present.\nTo create an Optional object, you can call the staticof() method and pass in a non-null value, or you can call the static empty() method to create an empty Optional object.\n\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nTo access the value of an Optional object, you can call the get() method, but it is recommended to first check if the value is present using the isPresent() method. If the value is not present, you can provide a default value using the orElse() or orElseGet() methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOptional is often used as a return type for methods that may or may not return a value, as a way to indicate that the method may return no value, and to avoid returning null references. It is also used in the Stream API to represent the possibility of an empty result set.\n\n\n\n5.1 Example\nimport java.util.Optional;\n\npublic class OptionalExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String name = \"John Doe\";\n        Optional<String> optionalName = Optional.of(name); // Create an Optional object with a non-null value\n        System.out.println(optionalName.isPresent()); // true\n        System.out.println(optionalName.get()); // \"John Doe\"\n\n        String nullName = null;\n        Optional<String> optionalNullName = Optional.ofNullable(nullName); // Create an Optional object with a null value\n        System.out.println(optionalNullName.isPresent()); // false\n\n        String defaultName = \"Jane Doe\";\n        String finalName = optionalNullName.orElse(defaultName); // Use the default value when the Optional is empty\n        System.out.println(finalName); // \"Jane Doe\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example, we create two Optional objects: optionalName, which contains a non-null value, and optionalNullName, which contains a null value.\nWe use the isPresent() method to check if the Optional objects contain a value, and the get() method to access the values. When optionalNullName is empty, we use the orElse() method to provide a default value."

    "text": "7 Method references\n\nMethod references are special types of lambda expressions that execute only one method.\nMethod reference is a shorthand syntax for referring to an existing method or constructor, without having to provide a full method implementation.\nIt is a way to pass a method as a parameter to another method or to create a functional interface instance.\n\n\n\nA comprehensive guide to Java 8 method reference\nQuickly writing Java lambdas and method references\n\nThey allow you to refer to a method by its name and optionally specify the object on which the method is invoked.\n\n\n\nMethod references\n\n\nThere are four types of method references:\n\nReference to a static method\nReference to an instance method of an object of a particular type\nReference to an instance method of an existing object\nReference to a constructor\n\n\n7.1 Example names print\nList<String> names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\n\n// Using lambda expression\nnames.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));\n\n// Using method reference\nnames.forEach(System.out::println);\nIn this example, we have a list of names and we want to print them to the console. We can achieve this using a forEach method that accepts a Consumer interface implementation. The Consumer interface has a single abstract method accept that takes an input and performs an operation on it.\nWe can pass a lambda expression or a method reference to the forEach method to define the Consumer implementation. In the lambda expression version, we define an anonymous function that takes a name parameter and prints it to the console using System.out.println(name).\nIn the method reference version, we refer to the println method of the System.out object using the syntax System.out::println. This is equivalent to passing a lambda expression that calls System.out.println(name) with the name parameter.\nBoth versions of the code produce the same output, but the method reference version is more concise and easier to read.\n\n\n7.2 Example names compareTo\nList<String> names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\n\n// Using lambda expression\nCollections.sort(names, (name1, name2) -> name1.compareTo(name2));\n\n// Using method reference\nCollections.sort(names, String::compareTo);\nIn this example, we have a list of names and we want to sort them in ascending order. We can achieve this using the sort method of the Collections class, which accepts a list and a Comparator implementation to define the sort order.\nWe can pass a lambda expression or a method reference to the sort method to define the Comparator implementation. In the lambda expression version, we define an anonymous function that takes two String parameters name1 and name2, and compares them using the compareTo method of String class.\nIn the method reference version, we refer to the compareTo method of the String class using the syntax String::compareTo. This is equivalent to passing a lambda expression that calls name1.compareTo(name2).\nBoth versions of the code produce the same output, but the method reference version is more concise and easier to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Java SE: Class and Objects \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Java SE: static modifier"

The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).\n\n\n\nmoviemodel.java\n\n// Abstract class\nabstract class Animal {\n  // Abstract method (does not have a body)\n  public abstract void animalSound();\n  // Regular method\n  public void sleep() {\n    System.out.println(\"Zzz\");\n  }\n}\n\n// Subclass (inherit from Animal)\nclass Pig extends Animal {\n  public void animalSound() {\n    // The body of animalSound() is provided here\n    System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\");\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n1.2 Interface\nTo access the interface methods, the interface must be “implemented” (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the “implement” class:\n\n\nmoviemodel.java\n\n// Interface\ninterface Animal {\n  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)\n}\n\n// Pig \"implements\" the Animal interface\nclass Pig implements Animal {\n  public void animalSound() {\n    // The body of animalSound() is provided here\n    System.out.println(\"The pig says: wee wee\");\n  }\n  public void sleep() {\n    // The body of sleep() is provided here\n    System.out.println(\"Zzz\");\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nLike abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects\nInterface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the “implement” class\nOn implementation of an interface, you** must override all of its methods**\nInterface methods are by default abstract and public\nInterface attributes are by default public, static and final\nAn interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)"

Interfaces allow for multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.\nInterfaces promote code reuse by allowing multiple classes to share a common set of methods or properties.\nJava’s support for default methods in interfaces allows for the addition of new methods to an interface without breaking existing code that implements the interface.\nInterfaces can be used to define a common API for different implementations of a specific functionality.\n\n\n\n2.2 Cons of using interfaces:\n\nAn interface does not provide any implementation for its methods or properties, so classes that implement an interface must provide their own implementation.\nInterfaces can lead to more complex code, as it may require more effort to understand how the different classes and interfaces relate to each other.\nInterfaces can make it more difficult to understand the relationships between classes, as it may not be immediately clear which classes implement a specific interface.\nInterfaces can lead to a proliferation of small, highly-specialized interfaces, which may make the codebase harder to understand and maintain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nJava does not support “multiple inheritance” (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Java SE: Packages \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Java SE: Encapsulation"

This allows the Dog class to inherit the characteristics of the Animal class, and add its own unique characteristics as well.\nIn this example, the Animal class is a superclass, and the Dog class is a subclass that extends the Animal class. The Dog class inherits all of the methods and fields of the Animal class, including the name field and the makeNoise() method.\nThe Dog class also has its own age field, which is not defined in the Animal class. It also provides its own implementation of the makeNoise() method, which overrides the implementation in the Animal class.

In Java, a variable that is declared within a class, but outside of any method, has class scope, which means that it can be accessed and used by any method within the class.\nIn this example, the classVariable variable is declared within the Example class, but outside of any method, so it has class scope. This means that the classVariable variable can be accessed and used by any method within the Example class, including the main method and the someMethod method.\nWhile Java doesn’t have a concept of global scope in the traditional sense, class scope provides a similar level of accessibility and usability for variables. By declaring variables within a class, but outside of any method, you can make those variables accessible and usable by any method within the class, which can be useful for sharing data and state between different parts of your program."

The MovieManager class has a new addMovie(String title, String director, String genre, double size) method that takes 4 parameters and it uses the movieFactory object to create a new Movie object with the provided parameters.\nThe MovieFactory interface defines a single method createMovie(String title, String director, String genre, double size) that creates a Movie object. The DefaultMovieFactory class is an implementation of this interface that creates the Movie objects by calling its constructor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe MovieManager uses the factory method createMovie() to create the movie objects rather than calling the constructor directly.\n\n\nThis way, if the implementation of how Movie objects are created needs to change in the future, only the DefaultMovieFactory class needs to be modified. The rest of the MovieManager class remains unchanged, so it provides flexibility to change the implementation in future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also have other implementation of MovieFactory, say like a SecureMovieFactory to create secure movies or any other such implementation. This way you can change the way movie object is created in future without modifying the code of MovieManager\nIt is worth noting that this is a simple example of the factory pattern and it can be applied in many ways based on the requirements and use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Lab#SE02-2: Movie/Review, CRUD Operations \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Lab#SE02-4: Movie/Review, interactivity and coupling"

    "text": "2 What is the Domain? DDD?\nTo define domain-driven design, we should first establish what we mean by domain in this context (and in development in general).\nThe standard dictionary definition of domain is: “A sphere of knowledge or activity.” Drilling down a bit from that, the domain in software engineering commonly refers to the subject area on which the application is intended to apply.\nIn other words, during application development, the domain is the sphere of knowledge and activity around which the application logic revolves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain-Driven Design: worth reading!\n\n\n\nCoupling degree in a project is highly related to the project desing stage. Using a Domain-Driven Design strategy can reduce the coupling between the different entities, value objects, domain events, etc…\n\n\n\n2.1 Ubiquitous Language\nUbiquitous Language is the term Eric Evans uses in Domain Driven Design for the practice of building up a common, rigorous language between developers and users.\nThis language should be based on the Domain Model used in the software - hence the need for it to be rigorous, since software doesn’t cope well with ambiguity.\n\n\n2.2 Extreme Programming (XP)\nExtreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology developed primarily by Kent Beck.\nXP was one of the first agile methods, indeed XP was the dominant agile method in the late 90s and early 00s before Scrum became dominant as the noughties passed: XP was the primary catalyst that got attention to agile methods.\n\n\n2.3 Technical debt\nSoftware systems are prone to the build up of cruft - deficiencies in internal quality that make it harder than it would ideally be to modify and extend the system further.\n\n\n2.4 Building Blocks\nDomain Driven Design also defines several high-level concepts that can be used in conjunction with one another to create and modify domain models:\n\nEntity\nValue Object\nDomain Event\nAggregate\nService\nRepository\nFactories\nController\nTest\nManager"

    "text": "3 Example: CarFactory\nHere is an example of decoupling in Java, using a CarFactory class to create different types of cars:\n\n\nCarFactory.java\n\npublic class CarFactory {\n    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation\n    private CarFactory() { }\n\n    // Factory method for creating cars\n    public static Car createCar(String type) {\n        switch (type) {\n            case \"sedan\":\n                return new Sedan(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2019);\n            case \"hatchback\":\n                return new Hatchback(\"Honda\", \"Fit\", 2019);\n            case \"suv\":\n                return new SUV(\"Jeep\", \"Grand Cherokee\", 2019);\n            default:\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid car type: \" + type);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nIn this example, the CarFactory class defines a createCar() method, which is marked as public and static. This method is the factory method, which is responsible for creating objects of the Car type. The createCar() method takes a type parameter, which specifies the type of car to create, and returns an instance of the appropriate concrete class.\nBy decoupling the CarFactory class from the code that uses the cars, you can make the code that uses the cars more flexible and reusable. For example, you could define a CarDriver class that takes a Car object as a parameter, and uses the Car object to drive the car. Because the CarDriver class doesn’t depend on the CarFactory class, you can use the CarDriver class to drive any type of car, regardless of how the car was created.\nAdditionally, by decoupling the CarFactory class from the code that uses the cars, you can make the logic for creating the cars more modular and maintainable. For example, if you want to add a new type of car, such as a truck, you can simply add a new Truck class that extends the Car class, and then update the CarFactory class to include logic for creating instances of the Truck class. Because the CarFactory class is decoupled from the code that uses the cars, you don’t have to change any other code in the system in order to add the new car type."

You may go to Lab 2 (go Lab#SE01-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to create three classes in Java (Person, Account and Manager) that implement different algorithms or data structures, and to test them using JUnit.  These classes could include, for example, creating new objects, a data structure for storing and manipulating data (List), or a utility class for performing common operations (static).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks involved in this project include: \n\n\nDecide where your project will weight: Person or Account.\n\n\nCreating a new Maven or Gradle project and setting up the project structure.\n\n\nModifying the project’s pom.xml or build.gradle file to import the necessary dependencies, including JUnit for testing.\n\n\nImplementing the three required classes in Java, using appropriate algorithms and data structures.\n\n\nImplementing as well two basic pattern-designs: singleton and composition.\n\n\nWriting JUnit tests to verify that the classes work as expected.\n\n\n\nYou may attach the JUnit Test HTML results to documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an optional task, you could also consider allowing the user to input data via the console, rather than using hard-coded test data in your JUnit tests.  This would allow you to test the classes with a variety of different input data, and to interact with the classes in a more dynamic way.\n\n\nAfter mplementing two basic pattern-designs: singleton, composition your may think about factory."

For example:\n// Create a new Person and Account\n// be careful: where will these four Person objects go? \nAccountManager manager = AccountManager.getInstance();\nmanager.person = new Person(\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Carla Jameson\", \"323 Main St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Rafael Martin\", \"3 Glorious St.\");\nmanager.person = new Person(\"Pau Vila\", \"63 Sesamo St.\");\nBut maybe, this is not the best approach for several reasons …\n\n\n2.4 Approach #2: all static-methods AccountManager\nIt may work as follows. In fact, if we want to manage accounts (as a banking-centered problem, not a person-centered one), it could be better that Account has Person:\n\n\n\n\n\nclassDiagram\n\nclass Person {\n  -name: String\n  -surname: String\n  -age: int\n}\n\nclass Account {\n  -accountNumber: String\n  -pin: int\n  -balance: double\n  -person: Person\n}\n\nAccount *-- Person\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic class Account {\n  private Person person;\n  //other fields\n\n  public Account(Person person) {\n    this.person = person;\n  }\n\n  public Person getPerson() {\n    return this.person;\n  }\n\n  public void setPerson(Person person) {\n    this.person = person;\n    \n    //constructor, getters, setters and methods\n  }\n}\nSo, in this case, we could use a List object to save all the Account objects with the list:\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private List<Account> accounts;\n\n  private AccountManager() {\n    this.accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n  }\n\n  public List<Account> getAccounts() {\n    return this.accounts;\n  }\n\n  // we should manage how to add/remove accounts to/from accounts list\n\n  public static void deposit(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to deposit the specified amount to the account\n  }\n\n  public static void changePin(Account account, int newPin) {\n    // Code to change the PIN of the specified account\n  }\n\n  public static void transfer(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {\n    // Code to transfer the specified amount from the fromAccount to the toAccount\n  }\n  \n  public static void withdrawal(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to withdraw the specified amount from the given account\n  }\n}\n\n\n2.5 Approach 3: Singleton, any static-method\nIn this approach:\n\nAccount has Person\nAccountManager is Singleton and there is no static-methods anywhere\nand we create just one object form AccountManager to manage accounts\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private static AccountManager manager = new AccountManager();\n  private List<Account> accounts;\n\n  // we should manage how to add/remove accounts to/from accounts list\n\n  private AccountManager() {\n    this.accounts = new ArrayList<>();\n  }\n\n  public static AccountManager getInstance() {\n    return manager;\n  }\n\n  public List<Account> getAccounts() {\n    return this.accounts;\n  }\n\n  public  void deposit(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to deposit the specified amount to the account\n  }\n\n  public  void changePin(Account account, int newPin) {\n    // Code to change the PIN of the specified account\n  }\n\n  public  void transfer(Account fromAccount, Account toAccount, double amount) {\n    // Code to transfer the specified amount from the fromAccount to the toAccount\n  }\n  \n  public  void withdrawal(Account account, double amount) {\n    // Code to withdraw the specified amount from the given account\n  }\n}\n\n\n2.6 Test: AccountManagerTest\nAccountManagerTest could be like this:\n\nwith AccountManager all static-methods no-singleton\nAccount has Person\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\npublic class AccountManagerTest {\n  @Test\n  public void testDeposit() {\n    Account account = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    double initialBalance = account.getBalance();\n    double depositAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.deposit(account, depositAmount);\n    double finalBalance = account.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialBalance + depositAmount, finalBalance);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testChangePin() {\n    Account account = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    int initialPin = account.getPin();\n    int newPin = 1234;\n\n    AccountManager.changePin(account, newPin);\n    int finalPin = account.getPin();\n\n    assertEquals(newPin, finalPin);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void testTransfer() {\n    Account fromAccount = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    Account toAccount = new Account(new Person(\"Jane Doe\"));\n    double initialFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double initialToAccountBalance = toAccount.getBalance();\n    double transferAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.transfer(fromAccount, toAccount, transferAmount);\n    double finalFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double finalToAccountBalance = toAccount.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialFromAccountBalance - transferAmount, finalFromAccountBalance);\n    assertEquals(initialToAccountBalance + transferAmount, finalToAccountBalance);\n  }\n  \n  @Test\n  public void testWithdrawal() {\n    Account fromAccount = new Account(new Person(\"John Doe\"));\n    Account toAccount = new Account(new Person(\"Jane Doe\"));\n    double initialFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n    double withdrawalAmount = 100.00;\n\n    AccountManager.withdrawal(fromAccount, withdrawalAmount);\n    double finalFromAccountBalance = fromAccount.getBalance();\n\n    assertEquals(initialFromAccountBalance -

The TemperatureDisplay class receives updates from the WeatherData class and displays the temperature on the console.\nWhen the temperature is set in the WeatherData class, it calls the notifyObservers() method which in turns calls the update() method of all the Observers. The TemperatureDisplay class receives the update and retrieves the temperature from the WeatherData instance and displays it on the console.\nThis pattern allows for a loosely coupled system, where the WeatherData class does not need to be aware of the existence of the TemperatureDisplay class and vice versa. The TemperatureDisplay class can be added or removed from the observer list without affecting the behavior of the WeatherData class.\n\nAbout this site \n\n\n\n  Structural: Decorator \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Behavioral: Strategy"

    "text": "1 Solving discussion\n\n1.1 Base Classes: factory\nHere is an example of how you could create a Lombok Java class for a Person and Account using the factory pattern:\nimport lombok.AllArgsConstructor;\nimport lombok.Data;\n\n@Data\n@AllArgsConstructor\npublic class Person {\n    private String firstName;\n    private String lastName;\n}\n\npublic interface Account {\n    void deposit(double amount);\n    void withdraw(double amount);\n}\n\n\npublic class SavingsAccount implements Account {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public SavingsAccount(double balance) {\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        this.balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        this.balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CheckingAccount implements Account {\n    private double balance;\n\n    public CheckingAccount(double balance) {\n        this.balance = balance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void deposit(double amount) {\n        this.balance += amount;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void withdraw(double amount) {\n        this.balance -= amount;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n    public static Account createAccount(String accountType, double balance) {\n        if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"savings\")) {\n            return new SavingsAccount(balance);\n        } else if (accountType.equalsIgnoreCase(\"checking\")) {\n            return new CheckingAccount(balance);\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\nYou can then use these classes as follows:\nPerson john = new Person(\"John\", \"Doe\");\nAccount savingsAccount = AccountManager.createAccount(\"savings\", 100.00);\nAccount checkingAccount = AccountManager.createAccount(\"checking\", 50.00);\nThe AccountManager class uses the factory pattern to create Account objects based on the specified accountType. This allows you to create different types of accounts without having to specify the exact class to use, and makes it easier to add new types of accounts in the future.\n\n\n1.2 Base Classes: local storage-JSON\nHere is an example of what a Lombok-based Person class and Account class might look like in Java:\nimport lombok.Data;\n\n@Data\npublic class Person {\n  private String name;\n  private int age;\n  private String address;\n}\n\n@Data\npublic class Account {\n  private int accountNumber;\n  private double balance;\n  private Person owner;\n}\nThe @Data annotation is a **Lombok* annotation that automatically generates getters and setters for all non-static fields, as well as equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods. This can help reduce boilerplate code and make your classes more concise and readable.\nTo save data to a local JSON file, you could use a JSON library like Jackson to convert the objects to JSON strings, and then write those strings to a file. Here is an example of how you might do that:\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException {\n    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);\n    // write the JSON string to a file\n  }\n}\nHow to save an object as a JSON string to a file on your local storage (in this case, c:/data/accounts.json) using Java SE:\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\npublic class AccountManager {\n  private ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n  public void saveAccount(Account account) throws JsonProcessingException, IOException {\n    String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(account);\n\n    FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter(\"c:/data/accounts.json\");\n    fileWriter.write(json);\n    fileWriter.close();\n  }\n}"

Here is a brief overview of some of the most common types of relationships:\n\nInheritance: Inheritance is a relationship between classes, where one class is a subclass of another class and inherits the properties and behavior of the superclass. This is represented in UML by a solid line with a closed, filled arrowhead pointing from the subclass to the superclass.\nComposition: Composition is a strong type of association that represents a whole-part relationship between two classes, where the parts cannot exist independently of the whole. This is represented in UML by a solid line with a closed diamond shape pointing from the whole to the part.\nAggregation: Aggregation is a weaker type of association that represents a whole-part relationship between two classes, where the parts can exist independently of the whole. This is represented in UML by a solid line with an open diamond shape pointing from the whole to the part.\nAssociation: Association is a relationship between two classes that represents a connection or relationship between them. This is represented in UML by a solid line with an open arrowhead pointing from one class to the other.\nDependency: Dependency is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class depends on the other for its functionality. This is represented in UML by a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing from the dependent class to the class it depends on.\nUse: Use is a relationship between two classes that indicates that one class uses the other in some way.

It is the ability of an object to take on different forms.\nIn other words, it is the ability of a single object to behave differently in different contexts.\n\n\nPolymorphism is an important concept in object-oriented programming because it allows developers to write code that is more flexible and reusable. By using polymorphism, developers can write code that can operate on objects of different types, without knowing the specific type of the object in advance.\n\n\n\nJava SE Basic Principles OOP Polymorphishm\n\n\nIn Java, polymorphism is achieved through the use of inheritance and interfaces. A subclass can implement multiple interfaces, and an interface can be implemented by multiple classes. This allows objects of different types to share a common set of methods, which can be called on the objects without knowing their specific type.\nHere is an example of polymorphism in Java using the Animal, Dog, and Cat classes from the previous examples:\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Dog object\n        Dog dog = new Dog(\"Buddy\", 5);\n\n        // Create a Cat object\n        Cat cat = new Cat(\"Whiskers\", 3);\n\n        // Call the makeNoise() method on the Dog object\n        dog.makeNoise();\n\n        // Call the makeNoise() method on the Cat object\n        cat.makeNoise();\n    }\n}\nIn this example, the Dog class and the Cat class both implement the Animal class, which defines the makeNoise() method. This means that the Dog and Cat classes both have their own implementations of the makeNoise() method.\nWhen the makeNoise() method is called on the dog object, it executes the implementation in the Dog class, which prints the “Woof!” message to the console. When the makeNoise() method is called on the cat object, it executes the implementation in the Cat class, which prints the “Meow!” message to the console."

    "text": "The state pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to dynamically alter their behavior based on internal state changes.\nThe State design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It provides a way to define a set of states and behaviors for a particular object, and allows the object to change its state at runtime. The State pattern is based on the idea of separating the behavior of an object from its state, which results in a more modular and flexible design.\nThe State pattern involves two main components: a Context and a State. The Context is the object whose behavior changes based on its internal state. The State is an interface or abstract class that defines the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context. The State objects are concrete classes that implement the State interface or extend the State abstract class, and define the behavior associated with each state.\nThe State pattern enables the Context object to change its behavior dynamically by delegating to the appropriate State object. When the internal state of the Context changes, the Context delegates to a different State object to handle the behavior associated with the new state. This allows the Context to appear to change its behavior at runtime, without changing its class or modifying its existing behavior.\nThe State pattern provides a way to encapsulate state-specific behavior into separate classes, which can be easily added, removed, or modified as needed. This makes it easier to add new states and behaviors to the object, and can result in a more maintainable and extensible codebase.\nOverall, the State pattern is useful in situations where the behavior of an object needs to change based on its internal state, and where it’s impractical to have a single class with conditional statements for each possible state. By encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes, the State pattern provides a flexible and modular way to handle state changes."

In this example, we’ll create a State`` interface with a method for dispensing an item from the vending machine:\n\npublic interface State {\n    void dispenseItem(VendingMachine vendingMachine);\n}\n\nCreate concrete state classes: These are the classes that implement the State interface or extend the State abstract class, and define the behavior associated with each state. In this example, we’ll create three concrete state classes: OutOfStockState, PaymentReceivedState, and ItemDispensedState:\n\npublic class OutOfStockState implements State {\n    public void dispenseItem(VendingMachine vendingMachine) {\n        System.out.println(\"Out of stock, please come back later\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PaymentReceivedState implements State {\n    public void dispenseItem(VendingMachine vendingMachine) {\n        System.out.println(\"Item dispensed\");\n        vendingMachine.setCurrentState(new ItemDispensedState());\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ItemDispensedState implements State {\n    public void dispenseItem(VendingMachine vendingMachine) {\n        System.out.println(\"Item already dispensed\");\n    }\n}\n\nUse the State pattern in the Context class: In the VendingMachine class, we’ll use the State pattern to change the behavior of the vending machine based on its internal state.\n\npublic class VendingMachine {\n    private State currentState;\n\n    public VendingMachine() {\n        // initialize the vending machine to the out of stock state\n        currentState = new OutOfStockState();\n    }\n\n    public void setCurrentState(State state) {\n        currentState = state;\n    }\n\n    public void dispenseItem() {\n        currentState.dispenseItem(this);\n    }\n\n    // other methods for handling payment, restocking items, etc.\n}\n\nTest the State pattern implementation: In the main method, we’ll create a new vending machine and test its behavior in different states:\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    VendingMachine vendingMachine = new VendingMachine();\n\n    // test the out of stock state\n    vendingMachine.dispenseItem(); // should print \"Out of stock, please come back later\"\n\n    // test the payment received state\n    vendingMachine.setCurrentState(new PaymentReceivedState());\n    vendingMachine.dispenseItem(); // should print \"Item dispensed\"\n\n    // test the item dispensed state\n    vendingMachine.dispenseItem(); // should print \"Item already dispensed\"\n}\nThat’s a basic example of how to implement the State pattern in Java. In a real-world application, there would likely be more states and behaviors to handle, but the basic principles of the pattern would remain the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Behavioral: Strategy \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Lab#SE00-1: Maven Person"

    "text": "The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for flexible behavior by encapsulating algorithms into separate classes for interchangeability and modularity.\nThe Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows for flexible behavior implementation by encapsulating algorithms into separate classes. This pattern is based on the principle of “composition over inheritance,” which means that it’s better to use composition and interfaces rather than inheritance to achieve flexibility and modularity.\nIn a typical implementation of the Strategy pattern, an interface or abstract class defines a set of methods that encapsulate a specific behavior or algorithm. Concrete classes implement these methods with their own specific implementation of the behavior. The context object that needs to use the behavior holds a reference to the abstract class or interface, and at runtime, the concrete implementation is chosen based on the current context.\nThe advantage of using the Strategy pattern is that it allows for interchangeable behavior implementation. By encapsulating the algorithms into separate classes, it’s easy to swap out one implementation for another at runtime, without changing the code of the context object. This makes the code more flexible, maintainable, and extensible."

It holds a reference to a SortingStrategy object and delegates the sorting operation to it.\n\nUse the Context Class with Different Strategies\n\nint[] data = {4, 2, 1, 5, 3};\nSorter sorter = new Sorter(new BubbleSort());\nsorter.sort(data); // Sort using bubble sort\n\nSorter sorter2 = new Sorter(new QuickSort());\nsorter2.sort(data); // Sort using quick sort\nThis code creates two instances of the Sorter class, one with a BubbleSort object and another with a QuickSort object. It then calls the sort() method on each instance, which delegates the sorting operation to the respective strategy object.\nBy using the Strategy pattern in this way, the behavior of the sorting operation can be easily changed by creating a new concrete strategy object and passing it to the Sorter object. This makes the code more flexible and easy to maintain, as changes to the sorting behavior can be made without modifying the Sorter class itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Behavioral: Observer \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Behavioral: State"

    "text": "2 Abstract class and Interface\nAbstraction is an important concept in object-oriented programming because it allows developers to create complex systems by building upon simpler components.\nThis makes it possible to manage large and complex code bases without becoming overwhelmed by the details.\nIn other words, abstraction means representing the essential features of an object without including the non-essential details. In Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n📘 How abstraction is done\nIn Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n\n\n\nAn abstract class is a class that contains one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared but not implemented. This means that subclasses of the abstract class must implement the abstract methods in order to use them.\nHere is an example of an abstract class in Java:\npublic abstract class Shape {\n    // This is an abstract class because it has an abstract method\n\n    public abstract double getArea();\n\n    // Non-abstract methods\n    public void draw() {\n        // Code for drawing the shape\n    }\n\n    public void move(int x, int y) {\n        // Code for moving the shape\n    }\n}\nIn this example, the Shape class is an abstract class because it contains an abstract method called getArea(). Subclasses of the Shape class, such as Circle or Rectangle, must implement the getArea() method in order to use it. This allows each subclass to provide its own implementation of the getArea() method, based on its specific characteristics.\nInterfaces are another way to achieve abstraction in Java. An interface is a collection of abstract methods and constant variables. A class that implements an interface must implement all of the abstract methods and constant variables defined in the interface.\nHere is an example of an interface in Java:\npublic interface Shape {\n    // This is an interface because it has only abstract methods\n\n    double getArea();\n\n    void draw();\n\n    void move(int x, int y);\n\n    // Constant variable\n    int MAX_SIZE = 100;\n}\nIn this example, the Shape interface defines three abstract methods and one constant variable. Any class that implements the Shape interface must implement all of the abstract methods and provide a value for the constant variable. This allows the class to define its own implementation of the abstract methods, based on its specific characteristics.\nHere is an example of how to implement the Shape interface in Java with Circle class:\npublic class Circle implements Shape {\n    // Private instance variable\n    private double radius;\n\n    // Constructor\n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    // Implementation of abstract method from Shape interface\n    @Override\n    public double getArea() {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n\n    // Implementation of abstract method from Shape interface\n    @Override\n    public void draw() {\n        // Code for drawing the circle\n    }\n\n    // Implementation of abstract method from Shape interface\n    @Override\n    public void move(int x, int y) {\n        // Code for moving the circle\n    }\n}\nIn this example, the Circle class implements the Shape interface. This means that the Circle class must implement all of the abstract methods defined in the Shape interface. The Circle class also has a private instance variable called radius, which is used to store the radius of the circle.\nThe Circle class provides its own implementation of the getArea() method, which calculates the area of the circle based on its radius. It also provides its own implementation of the draw() and move() methods, which are used to draw and move the circle on the screen.\nOverall, this example shows how to implement an interface in Java. By implementing the Shape interface, the Circle class can provide its own implementation of the abstract methods defined in the interface, based on its specific characteristics."

To access these data members, the member function’s scope must be set to public, while the data members’ scope must be set to private.\nAccording to this theory, an item contains all important information; only a small subset is made available to the outside world.

Each of these classes is marked with the @Data annotation from the Lombok library, which generates the appropriate getters, setters, and constructors for the class. This means that you don’t have to write these methods manually, which can save a lot of time and effort.\nTo use the CarFactory class, you would call the createCar() method, passing in the type of car you want to create.

    "text": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concepts of objects and classes, which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. OOP is based on several key principles, including the following:\n\n\n\n\nJava SE Basic Principles OOP\n\n\nEncapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the idea of combining data and the code that manipulates that data into a single unit, or object. This allows for better organization and modularity of code, and helps to hide the internal details of an object from other parts of the program.\nAbstraction: Abstraction is the process of representing essential features without including the details. In OOP, abstraction is often achieved through the use of interfaces or abstract classes, which define a set of common methods that can be implemented by different classes in different ways. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability of code.\nInheritance: Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit the attributes and behaviors of another class. In OOP, a class can inherit from a parent class, also known as a superclass, and can override or extend the methods of the parent class to add new functionality. This allows for code reuse and makes it easier to create hierarchies of classes.\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows for the use of a single interface to refer to objects of different types. This allows for greater flexibility and code reuse, as the same method can be used on objects of different types and the appropriate implementation will be called based on the type of the object.\n\nOverall, the principles of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are fundamental to OOP and form the basis for many of its benefits, such as modularity, flexibility, code reuse, and ease of maintenance.\n\n\nObjects can interact with each other by sending and receiving messages, or method calls, to access and modify their data.\nObjects are created from classes, which are templates that define the structure and behavior of objects.\n\n\n\nExample object in Java\n\n\n\n📘 Object-oriented programming (OOP)\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a self-contained unit that combines data and the code that manipulates that data.\nAn object is a data structure that contains:\n\nattributes, or properties, that describe the object, defines the state’s object\nand methods, or functions, that define the behavior of the object.\n\n\n\nIn Java, objects are created using the new keyword, and their attributes and methods can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Objects are an important concept in OOP and are central to many of its benefits, such as modularity, code reuse, and flexibility.\n\nPerson carla = new Person(\"Carla\", 21, \"red hair\", 45.000);\n\n\n\nIn object-oriented programming (OOP):\n\nThe constructor is a special type of method that is used to create and initialize an object. In Java, a constructor is a method that has the same name as the class and is used to create an instance of the class. A constructor can take arguments, which are used to initialize the object’s attributes, or properties.\nThe state of an object refers to the values of its attributes at a given moment in time.\nThe behavior of an object refers to the actions or operations that it can perform. In Java, the behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are functions that are associated with the object and can be called to perform actions on the object.\n\nOverall, a constructor, state, and behavior are important concepts in OOP and are closely related.\nA constructor is used to create and initialize an object, and its state and behavior are defined by its attributes and methods, respectively. In Java SE, these concepts are central to the creation and use of objects, and are fundamental to the flexibility and power of the Java language.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Java Standard Edition: Basics \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n Java MOOC Helsinki"

The facade pattern provides a simple, unified interface to the complex building, so you only have to worry about interacting with the door, rather than navigating the entire building.\nSimilarly, in software development, the facade pattern provides a simple interface to a complex system, so that client code can interact with the system without having to understand all of its complexities.

Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like [dep1, dep2, dep3].

Finally, it will execute the console.log('End') line.\nSynchronous code is easy to understand and debug, because the order of execution is clear and predictable. However, it can be less efficient than asynchronous code, because it can block the program from moving on to other tasks until the current task is complete.\n\nSynchronous code may be is easy but blocking.\n\nThis is the basic problem with long-running synchronous functions.

However, the principles of COP can be applied to other programming languages and paradigms as well.\nOne of the main benefits of the components-oriented paradigm is that it helps to improve the maintainability and scalability of an application. By encapsulating functionality into discrete, reusable components, it becomes easier to modify and extend the application over time.\nAdditionally, the use of standardized, modular components can make it easier to build larger applications by allowing developers to reuse and compose components rather than building everything from scratch."

React then compares this new tree to the previous VDOM tree, using a process called “diffing.”\nIn React, the virtual DOM VDOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It is a tree-like structure with a hierarchy of node objects that corresponds to the structure of the DOM. Each node in the VDOM tree represents an element in the actual DOM, and has properties that correspond to the attributes and content of that element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDuring the diffing process, React compares the two VDOM trees, node by node, and determines which nodes have changed, added, or removed. React then updates the actual DOM with the minimum number of changes necessary to reflect the changes in the VDOM.\n\n\nThis process helps to improve the performance of React applications, because it reduces the number of DOM manipulations that are required to keep the DOM up-to-date with the component’s state.\nThe diffing algorithm used by React is based on a concept called reconciliation. During reconciliation, React compares the VDOM nodes and their children, and determines the minimum number of steps that are needed to transform the old tree into the new tree.\nThis process helps to minimize the number of DOM manipulations that are required, and makes React updates faster and more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n  React JS: Introduction \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n React JS: Create a React project"

    "text": "1.2 Overview\nSome of the main features of React.js include:\n\nIt is a single-page application (SPA) framework, which means it allows developers to create web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the page in response to user actions without reloading the page. This makes React applications faster and more responsive than traditional web applications.\nComponents: In React, everything is a component. Components are small, reusable pieces of code that can be easily combined to create complex user interfaces.\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve the performance of components. The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM, and it allows React to update only the specific components that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire page.\nJSX: React uses JSX, which is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code that can be compiled into JavaScript. This allows developers to use familiar HTML tags and attributes to build React components, making it easier to write and understand React code.\nState: React components have a built-in state object that stores the local data of a component. The state of a component can be updated in response to user actions or other events, and the updated state will automatically be reflected in the user interface.\nProps: In React, components can receive data from their parent components through props, which are essentially input parameters that allow components to be customized and reused. Props can be used to pass data, functions, or any other type of information to a child component.\nRouting: React Router is a popular library that provides routing capabilities to React applications. It allows developers to define the different routes of the application, and to map each route to a specific component. This makes it possible to create a single-page application with multiple pages and views, without reloading the page."

    "text": "1.3 Key-concept: Hooks\nIn React, Hooks are a new feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features without writing a class. They are designed to make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components, and to better manage side effects in function components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n📘 Clear lifecycle\nHooks allow developers to use state and other React features by writing functions, rather than creating class-based components. This makes it possible to use state and other React features without the overhead of managing a class and its lifecycle.\n\n\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\nFor example, instead of using a class to define a component, you can use the useState Hook to add state to a function component:\nIn this example, the useState Hook is used to add state to the Example component. The useState function returns a pair of values: the current state, and a function that can be used to update the state. The current state is stored in the count variable, and the function to update the state is stored in the setCount variable.\nHooks are a powerful and flexible tool that can help simplify and improve the way you write React components. They allow you to use state and other React features without the overhead of class-based components, and they make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components."

The useState function returns a pair of values: the current state, and a function that can be used to update the state.\nThe current state is stored in the count variable, and the function to update the state is stored in the setCount variable.\nThese variables are used in the JSX code of the component to render the current state and to update the state in response to user actions. This allows the different types of code to be combined into a single, cohesive unit using Hooks."

    "text": "5 Updating arrays without mutation\n\n5.1 Example 1\nUpdating arrays without mutation is important in React because it helps to ensure that the state of your application remains predictable and easy to debug. When you mutate an array in place, you change its original value, which can make it difficult to understand what has changed and why.\nIn React, it’s generally recommended to avoid mutating the state directly, and instead to create new copies of the state with the desired changes applied. This ensures that the original state is preserved, and makes it easier to understand how the state of your application is changing over time.\nHere’s an example of how you might update an array without mutation in React using the map function:\n\n\nApp.js\n\nconst [items, setItems] = useState([1, 2, 3]);\n\nconst updateItem = index => {\n  setItems(items.map((item, i) => (i === index ? item * 2 : item)));\n};\n\n\n\nUpdating arrays without mutation can help to ensure that the state of your code remains predictable and easy to understand, which can make it easier to develop and maintain.\nIn this example, the updateItem function takes an index as an argument, and uses the map function to create a new array with the item at the specified index doubled. The setItems function is then called with the new array, which updates the state of the items array without mutating the original value.\n\n\n5.2 Example 2\nAdding to array with useState:\n\nAnd instead of using push(), we will create a new array which contains the existing items and a new item at the end. There are multiple ways to do this, but the easiest one is to use the ... array spread syntax:\n\n\n\nApp.js\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nlet nextId = 0;\n\nexport default function List() {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>\n      <input\n        value={name}\n        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setName('');\n        setArtists([\n          ...artists,\n          { id: nextId++, name: name }\n        ]);\n      }}>Add</button>\n      <ul>\n        {artists.map(artist => (\n          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray using ... spread inital render\n\n\n\n\n\n\narray using ... spread new render\n\n\n\nThe array spread syntax also lets you prepend an item by placing it before the original ...artists:\n\n\nApp.js\n\nsetArtists([\n  { id: nextId++, name: name },\n  ...artists // Put old items at the end\n]);\n\nIn this way, spread can do the job of both push() by adding to the end of an array and unshift() by adding to the beginning of an array.\n\n\n\n\n\n  ReactJS: useState \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n React JS: useRef"

Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.\n\n\n\n\n\nProps are properties passed to a child component that can hold many data types (e.g. array, object, number, function, others).\n\n\nIn React JS, data flows in one direction, from Parent to Child. This helps components to be simple and predictable.\n\n\n\n“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” -Leonardo da Vinci\n\nUse the same syntax as HTML attributes to send props into a component:\n\n\nprofile.jsx\n\nfunction Avatar({ person, size }) {\n  // person and size are available here\n}\n\n\n\nlin.jsx\n\nexport default function Lin() {\n  return (\n    <Avatar\n      person={{ name: 'Lin Lanying', imageId: '1bX5QH6' }}\n      size={100}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n\n\ncarla.jsx\n\nexport default function Carla() {\n  return (\n    <Avatar\n      person={{ name: 'Carla Lan', imageId: 'KIU3QH1' }}\n      size={60}\n    />\n  );\n}"

These kinds of JavaScript values are immutable, meaning unchangeable or read-only. You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:\n\n\nHello.jsx\n\nsetX(5);\n\nThe x state changed from 0 to 5, but the number 0 itself did not change. It’s not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.\nNow consider an object in state:\n\n\nHello.jsx\n\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\nTechnically, it is possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a mutation:\n\n\nHello.jsx\n\nposition.x = 5;\n\nHowever, although objects in React state are technically mutable, you should treat them as if they were immutable—like numbers, booleans, and strings.

During the first render, number was 0.\nAnd this is like this because number is … a state.\nSo, during execution lines #10, #11 and #12, number value is …0!\n\n\nThis is why, in that render’s onClick handler, the value of number is still 0 even after setNumber(number + 1) was called .. three times!!!\n\n\n6.2 Example 2: State over time\nState over time, step by step how setting and render do not happen at same moment.\n\n\nApp.js\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(number + 5);\n        alert(number);\n      }}>+5</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial render, number state is 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetting number state to 5, but first React will execute line #11, alert, and number state still is 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext render, number state now is now 5\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert is helping us to understand why setting and render are two different moments\n\nSetting number state to 5, but first React will execute line #11, alert, and number state still is 0\n\n\n6.3 Example 3: email\nHere is an example of how that makes your event handlers less prone to timing mistakes. Below is a form that sends a message with a five-second delay. Imagine this scenario:\n\nYou press the Send button, sending Hello to Alice.\nBefore the five-second delay ends, you change the value of the To field to Bob.\n\n\n\nApp.js\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice');\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');\n\n  function handleSubmit(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`);\n    }, 5000);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <label>\n        To:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={to}\n          onChange={e => setTo(e.target.value)}>\n          <option value=\"Alice\">Alice</option>\n          <option value=\"Bob\">Bob</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <textarea\n        placeholder=\"Message\"\n        value={message}\n        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial render\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext render\n\n\n\nReact keeps the state values fixed within one render’s event handlers.\nYou don’t need to worry whether the state has changed while the code is running.\n\n\n6.4 Example 4: state updater function\nIt is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before the next render, instead of passing the next state value like setNumber(number + 1), you can pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like setNumber(n => n + 1).\nIt is a way to tell React to do something with the state value instead of just replacing it.\n\n\nApp.js\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{number}</h1>\n      <button onClick={() => {\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n        setNumber(n => n + 1);\n      }}>+3</button>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial render\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext render\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  React JS: JSX \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n React JS ES6: arrow functions"

Here’s an example:\n\n\nApp.js\n\nconst obj = {\n  foo: 1,\n  bar: 2\n};\n\nconst { foo, bar } = obj;\n\nconsole.log(foo); // 1\nconsole.log(bar); // 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  React JS ES6: array, data and key \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n React JS ES6: spread operator"

    "text": "3 Passing event handlers as props\nOften you’ll want the parent component to specify a child’s event handler. Consider buttons: depending on where you’re using a Button component, you might want to execute a different function—perhaps one plays a movie and another uploads an image.\nTo do this, pass a prop the component receives from its parent as the event handler like so:\n\n\nindex.js\n\nfunction Button({ onClick, children }) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction PlayButton({ movieName }) {\n  function handlePlayClick() {\n    alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>\n      Play \"{movieName}\"\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction UploadButton() {\n  return (\n    <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>\n      Upload Image\n    </Button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function Toolbar() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PlayButton movieName=\"Kiki's Delivery Service\" />\n      <UploadButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting index.js:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Toolbar component renders PlayButton and UploadButton components. Second, both of them call their functions and then, each one call Button to render the button\n\n\n\nHere, the Toolbar component renders a PlayButton and an UploadButton:\n\nPlayButton passes handlePlayClick as the onClick prop to the Button inside.\nUploadButton passes() => alert('Uploading!') as the onClick prop to the Button inside.\n\nFinally, your Button component accepts a prop called onClick. It passes that prop directly to the built-in browser <button> with onClick={onClick}. This tells React to call the passed function on click.\n\n\n\n\n\n  React JS App: async \n\n\n\n  top \n\n\n\n React JS App: router"
